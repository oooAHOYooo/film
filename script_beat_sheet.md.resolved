Deliver these specific adjustments to your script to tighten the narrative and fix inconsistencies.

---

### **ACT I: The Discovery**

#### **Scene 01: Arrival**
- **REMOVE**: Makayla's line about "BinzoBee" and "Ophragah."
- **ADD**: Makayla notes the "resonance signature" of the oscillator.
- **BEAT**: Make Makayla sound like she's been studying the marsh for years, just without the academic degree Dallas has.

#### **Scene 06: News Vans**
- **ADD**: A beat where Dallas takes a high-res photo of the burn marks on the driveway before Dominic pulls him away.
- **BEAT**: This establishes Dallas's scientific curiosity and gives him "data" to look at later.

#### **Scene 08: Trailcam**
- **REMOVE**: The redundant "Dallas walks with Howie" action lines (lines 32-34).
- **ADD**: A moment where Dallas double-checks the trailcam's solar pack.

#### **Scene 09: The Injured One**
- **ADD**: A moment of hesitation. Dallas looks at his watch—it’s spinning wildly. He realizes he can't leave the creature to be "canceled" by the storm.
- **REMOVE**: The "dazed" repetition. Dallas is *choosing* to interfere.

### **ACT II: The Triage & The Secret**

#### **Scene 11: Kitchen Triage**
- **REMOVE**: The "syringe of chemicals."
- **ADD**: Dallas uses a series of 9-volt batteries to create a "healing pulse" through the receiver.
- **BEAT**: The creature literally feeds on the electrical current, causing the lights to dim.

#### **Scene 14: The Vision**
- **REMOVE**: Makayla saying "I feel a bit uninspired."
- **ADD**: Makayla: "Everything feels... quiet. Too quiet. Like the world is holding its breath."
- **MOVE**: Mention the "1978" files here (from s22) to give them a reason to build the trap now.

#### **Scene 15: Makayla's Lair**
- **ADD**: A full beat for Asher's recovery from the trance. He gasps—his eyes clear—and he draws a "Red Eye" with a single line through it.
- **BEAT**: This foreshadows the "cancelation" logic.

---

### **ACT III: The Confrontation & Resolution**

#### **Scene 20: Town Commons**
- **REMOVE**: The current placeholder.
- **ADD**: A "Gearing Up" montage. Makayla raiding Dominic's garage for extra cables; Asher checking the battery levels; Dallas looking at the 1978 sketches.

#### **Scene 21 & 22: The Consistency Fix**
- **DECISION**: The creature DOES NOT escape in s21.
- **REMOVE**: The "The creature has escaped!" line from s21.
- **BEAT**: They finish the Lifegroup, then quietly carry the shoebox out of the house like a tactical mission.

#### **Scene 24: The Burn Marks**
- **ADD**: The "vein" burn marks on Dallas's arm pulse in sync with the distant hum.
- **BEAT**: Externalizing the internal threat.

#### **Scene 27: The Trap**
- **REMOVE**: Pat Clendenen’s news report.
- **ADD**: Over the speakers, we hear the *Golden Note* multiplied—a wall of harmonic sound that physically repels the Red-Eyes.

#### **Scene 29: Aftermath**
- **REMOVE**: The horror sting of the red eye behind Pat.
- **ADD**: Asher is drawing a large, complex mural on the sidewalk. It's the face of the woman from the vision (Sierra).
- **FINAL BEAT**: Dallas looks at the drawing, looks at the marsh, and hears the "Alphabet" for the first time.
