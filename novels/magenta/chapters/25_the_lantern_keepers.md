# The Lantern Keepers

**Chapter 36: Bikes Stolen**

Fuck New Haven. I couldn't take it—and neither could Kenny Lewis—we both were steaming down in the kitchen—Lewis over justice—me over just the feeling of obstruction—and sick and tired of all of the gangster nonsense—I wanted the gangster to change their ways—and just be cool and relax—and stop stealing—and just change their vibes—I didn't like the idea of punishment—but I did want folks to feel sorry for what they have done.

Kenny Lewis believed strongly in the justice system and wanted them to face a jury and go through the process—and I was like dude—those bikes were like 400 total—probably more—probably less—who cares. He didn't like that—for he cared—for reasons, still I can't make out. Regardless he made it clear that he'd be investing in Ring cameras—Josh said he'd put 20 towards that—and I agreed to as well—but I knew that Kenny Lewis knew that I knew the price would be closer to 500.

"Dear Bike Thief, Attached to this letter are some sunflower seeds—go right now—we hope that you plant them in a garden of your choosing—and have fun with it baby—stop being so wack—plant a plant and stop being so gangster—you aren't impressing me—but you could—What WOULD impress me—is if you go and plant a plant—a sunflower—and walk by it everyday—and write a poem—and stop the bullshit—we get it—life sucks—but common—we dare you to plant that plant and challenge you to be cute about it."

Kenny Lewis shrugged his shoulders—"I guess you could write that." Josh was more reassuring than us all—and we took a nice pause that night and watched The Office on Peacock. In the end—I didn't trash the letter—but hung it on our fridge. Kenny Lewis was looking out the window, scouring the streets. I gave him a hug and he flinched a bit—then froze—then let it happen. I haven't hugged a man like that for a while—and to be honest—I loved it—it felt good to hug that frozen man.

Those who tend the lanterns tell the true history. Their testimony is not what anyone expected.

**Focus:**
- Subvert the legend (the letter, the sunflower, the hug).
- Move toward reconciliation (Kenny Lewis, Josh, the fridge).
