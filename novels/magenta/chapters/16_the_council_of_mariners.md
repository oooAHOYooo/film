**Chapter 20: The Unlikely Team—The Start of the Treasure Hunt**

By and by the days grew—and I thought about the gold. I wondered what it was like to be Captain Kidd—I'd heard of his name but seldom looked him up—I didn't want to—for in my mind it was romantic with the name—and I was wary the deeper I dove the more it'd beat me up—let not my right hand know what the left was doing and this would stop before it started.

I read or heard or thought once—that to help with the habit of judgement—it is best to think of everyone as a sad little kid trying their best—so I did—I thought of Kenny Lewis as a child with his mom working late—him being in the corner at recess working on a lego robotic—only to have some insecure girl walk over and spill milk on the fat kid—that poor big belly bearded man must have been like as a child. And I realized that he just wanted an opportunity to feel smart and to use his extreme common sense in a passionate way—but he would himself never take any action because he was cursed with the mindset—that many share—that neither knows any kind of progress because they find holes in the plan. Fuck them—but fuck it—I needed him—thought it'd be best to use him as a way to find holes in the boat.

I thought it'd be best if we do a group picture before and after the gold and have a calendar as to prove to the future generations we saw this. Stories for the grandkids—would be the slogan.

The next day we met outside gCafe on Orange Street near Trinity. We went over to the bar but discovered that it wasn't open until 3pm or so—so we made quick work of the outside benches.

Together we were Kenny Lewis, Sandra the Librarian, Dominic the Gypsy who couldn't today—Dave Gunn—and Lauren Bird—a girl I tutored in computer science a couple of summers ago.

We were a small group—but we were handsome. I also liked the number of the group. 5. 5 people. 6 including myself. 5 to keep things odd. 5 to keep things honest if there was a vote and a potential for disagreement. Yet I didn't foresee any such.

I handed everyone the sheet of paper and they glanced over it. Kenny Lewis held the sheet and looked unimpressed.

"What's this about heading off to Dave's caddymaster friend?"

"It's a jumping off point," said I—"someone should take notes and start collecting all of our jumping off points."

"I can," said Sandra.

And just like that the meeting began.

"Thank you all for joining—I wrote a little docket to help keep us honest and keep the momentum going. I expect that there are going to be some questions"—I looked at Kenny Lewis in jest—"But I hope that this meeting we can tune them up."

"I appreciate you all making the time for this—I hope to embark on a long journey with you all and come out of the other side of it a renewed and more retrospective person."

Kenny Lewis sighed.

"But presently, I only have about 45 minutes until I have to catch a zoom call for work—so today will be brief."

I continued.

"You can see that I made a little one pager for you fine folk—a scattering of ideas I wrote while shaving this morning on a notepad—and compiled them into a one page format during lunch. Thus please, and kindly, disregard the shoddy format—but I figured it be best to share. Oh and also, I believe I shared them all to your Google Drive—sans Mr. Dave Gunn—who uses Yahoo."

"Still holding strong," replied Gunn.

"You can see I composed everything into a list format and created a basic outline of what it would take to engage in such an endeavor—Now—I never had any time to compile this—so I used ChatGPT to compile a list—actually did well on its first try."

"Great—so you haven't done any work then?" replied Kenny Lewis.

"AI is a tool," replied I. "What do you want me to take 3 hours and copy and paste blog articles? What does it matter? I did work—I prompted it. Peppered it. Whatever."

I took a deep breath and took a sip of coffee.

"Let's start with line item 1."

I began to read.

"Research and Planning: Begin by researching the treasure hunt location or theme. Gather information about any clues, riddles, or historical context associated with the treasure. Plan out the logistics, such as transportation, accommodations, and duration of the hunt."

"Okay so—maybe we pin this one up for now—as it will prompt longer conversations. For brevity—let's move on to Item 2: Gather a Team: Decide if you want to undertake the treasure hunt alone or with a group. If you choose a team, recruit friends or family members who share your enthusiasm and have complementary skills."

"Okay nice—well we can cross this item off—look around—this is the team."

Everyone awkwardly glanced at each other and smiled.

"Line Item 3—Equipment Checklist: Create a checklist of essential equipment you might need during the treasure hunt. This may include a map, compass, GPS device, flashlights, batteries, notepad and pen, camera, magnifying glass, shovel, and other tools based on the nature of the hunt."

"I thought we were running out of time—that you had only 45 minutes—well it's like 35 left now—do you really want to read each one of these out?" snarked Kenny.

Dave Gunn chuckled—Sandra scribbled something on her page. I was losing them.

"Alright fine—Mr. Lewis is right—I'll read just the titles of each line item—and we can decide which one we can use this meeting to talk about… Sandra—are you cool to take some action items based on what we talk about?"

"I can try."

"Thank you Sandra… Okay—Lines 3 through 10: Equipment Checklist. Physical Fitness. Navigation Skills. Problem Solving and Riddles. Safety Measures. Dress Appropriately. Food and Water. Mental Preparation."

"Do we know what we want to talk about now?"

Dave Gunn smiled and looked. "I'd like to talk about navigation skills… Where exactly are we navigating?"

"To Thimble Islands," replied I.

"So like, yeah, but what does that involve? What kind of navigating are we talking about?"

"That's a good question… Kenny, what do you think?"

"Get a boat and sail? Idk," replied Kenny in jest.

"I mean, I know how to sail—and my caddy master has a boat," replied Dave.

"Do you think he would let us use it?" asked I.

"I can check. I guess." Dave took a breath. "It would be kind of weird though. Not really sure what I'd say."

"Lauren, do you mind looking up how much a boat costs on Facebook Marketplace? Sandra—please write in the action items of the meeting notes—decide upon navigation."

Lauren Bird gave me a salute.

"Why do we need a boat at all?" asked Kenny Lewis.

"What are you talking about?—how are we going to get to that island?"

"Well first, which island are you talking about. And second—we could just kayak."

"Kayak with a lot of gold? You Mr. Physics out of us all should know that we can't."

"Kayaks can hold up to 600 pounds. I don't think any of us are over 200 pounds."

"Well Dominic," I said under my breath.

"Even Dominic—if he was 300 pounds—that's still 300 pounds left over—do you think we're going to find more than 300 pounds of gold?"

"That's a good point."

Kenny continued. "The coin I found was around 2 ounces." "Which is great." "Well."

"I like the boat because it implies that we have great ambition. Doesn't seem to have much as a kayak."

Kenny Lewis was visibly getting upset.

"Okay—let's move on."

"Sandra—is there anything on this list that you would like to talk about? Any sort of leads or brainstorms?"

"Maybe the Food and Water?"

"Sure—that's a fun one to talk about."

"How long are we going to go for?" asked Dave.

"Probably around 7 hours total."

Someone looked around—I can head to Costco.

On the way home I met with Gonz outside the P&M—he was on a walk and was carrying a skateboard. He had a six pack of Sea Hags and asked if I'd like to join. Had to.

He asked me how it was to be an alderman. I knew not to tell him too much of the treasure—I think he'd run away with the idea—but I didn't know really what to make of him. I never have seen him in the same outfit twice and mainly reliant on what others say about him. This was the king? thought I—this dispelled—

Sailors and navigators argue over routes. Their debates reveal a fracture in the old order.

**Focus:**
- Expose political tension (Kenny's holes, boat vs kayak, the meeting).
- Choose a risky route (the treasure hunt; the crew; gCafe; Gonz).
