# The Second Haven

**Chapter 38: Three Weeks—Gather, Sultan, Flyers, Door to Door**

Three weeks came and went and not much went on—besides everything.

I settled on a design for the popup cafe laundromat but I second guessed myself. I asked around. I went to Gather and talked to Sultan about the idea—he loved it and encouraged me—I went home that night and talked to Kenny Lewis—he discouraged me. Back and forth back and forth pros and cons list—realizing that I was confronting a certain fear I had by making the decision. I spoke to my mom on the phone that night and found out that my grandmother fell ill and had to be rushed to the ER—my parents—presently having covid—couldn't go and visit her—so that was it—she was stressed on the phone.

I decided to take some action—and gave a hard look at the backyard. I wrote a list of 20 or so folks who I knew would come—but then what—it would turn into a party. So—not wanting it to turn into a party—but a functional business—I decided that we needed to be out and about. I thought about the New Haven Green—and Google mapped it a bit. I gave the school outside of Westville a call and they agreed to it. But I knew that we would have to spread the idea—so I contacted the local 8 news—and they sent out a reporter to follow—and then I hung posters all around town.

I printed 1000 off of Moo.com for around 200 bucks—that of which I used an Apple credit card because I still had 18 months at 0 APR. I printed a map—and I made pins where each and every—I used Google Earth—to scour each and every little popup—and then on a Google Map—I printed—I circled roughly where each one was—I counted 15. Okay—so for the other 9985 flyers—Kenny Lewis suggested that we put them door to door. I called Dominic and the rest of the Gypsy brigade—I had Dave on skates—all handing out to college kids. We would flood the streets—once a week and gather feedback—see if anyone used the QR code.

A place believed lost still stands. The arrival is bittersweet and filled with ghosts.

**Focus:**
- Deliver a major reveal (the popup, the flyers, East Haven / second haven).
- Show the cost of survival (grandmother, mom, Kenny Lewis con, the 200 bucks).
