# The Festival of Gate Lanterns

I enjoyed the nautical homage—and the 2 for $11 Sea Hag deal—the hag hands they called it—perhaps got carried away.

I told him that if I ever got to the place in my life where I felt I needed to read index cards out loud to strangers—I would go as "The Sea Hag."

The next couple of days were a lot of back and forth strip malls and dollar trees—I realized that I might have picked up too much Tupperware—but didn't care. I went to a park called Wooster Park and marveled at all of the different brick work—and all of the different parks—and all of the dogs and the leashes and everyone in between. There were walks of every life in this bunch—blends of Crayola crayons—but the boxes were different—much different.

The next act was decent. The music started. This dude had a synthesizer plugged into a mini amp that he used triple A batteries with aluminum foil to turn them into double A batteries—and took his damn time on the whammy. But I went home that night a little defeated.

**Focus:**
- Show the town's tradition (index cards, hag hands, Wooster Park, brick work).
- Seed the cost of failure (went home defeated).
