# The Broken Causeway

There was much talk about buying versus renting a boat and Kenny Lewis didn't know why there was so much talking about something—where renting was the real answer. I, having a fear of having to share the spoils with the chef, didn't want any future nonsense—if we owned the boat—we have control—we can go and rent—I would argue—yes—but what if there is no treasure—Captain Kidd's treasure on Thimble Island—because you found a gold coin. We found a gold coin—I would interject.

It's hard to lead a group of pirates when the first couple of mates do not show you the respect that you want.

Perhaps in Chapter 22—that is the day before they go for the treasure—it is Josh's birthday and there is a general kumbaya.

A causeway has fallen into the water. The detour is longer and demands more supplies.

**Focus:**
- Force a sacrifice of resources (buy vs rent; control vs cost).
- Reveal who the group trusts (Kenny Lewis, Josh, the debate).
