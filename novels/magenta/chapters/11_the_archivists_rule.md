# The Archivist's Rule

**Chapter 6: Moving to the New House**

I was living with 3 guys from Yale. They played Catan—they were obnoxious and dirty and rude. Living there was hell and not worth mentioning more. It gave me a strong distaste for the lack of styles of men. And there was many a night I Pinterest-ed classical art via men to establish my sanity and hope for the future.

Then I—after visiting church one time—went and moved into a house with Josh, Kenny Lewis, and myself—the 4th was always revolving—and we liked it that way—lest I did at first—Kenny Lewis was upset at the filament.

A keeper of records demands a story in exchange for a passage. Memory becomes currency.

**Focus:**
- Trade a truth for access (church, new house, Josh and Kenny Lewis).
- Expose a past wound (the Yale guys, hell, the filament).
