# The Hawser's End

**The Treasure's True Value.** The friends decide to use the treasure to benefit the community—planning a museum and educational programs.

**Chapter 35: Branford Library—Money**

I took a long drive. I ended up at Branford Library—Blackstone to be precise—lest I think that's what it was called. I was caught up worrying about money again—the 5k I ended up making from spoils of the treasure hunt last summer—rested pretty—in a 4.5% APR money market account that was tempting me terribly.

I, having no foreseeable income other than the Alderman stipend of $3,600 promised to me come May—was fighting desperation. The last website I built was for an author—which whom I will not name—no no no—but it was okay—the gentleman paid me 3 installments of $4000 dollars—which after taxes—came out to be three installments of $950 dollars—which honestly—sucked—being that my rent was also $950. I didn't want to be in the red—but if something didn't change soon—my little budgeting app would be very, very sad.

I calculated my fixed costs and determined that the money for food and what not would have to come elsewhere—thus I took 2k from my life savings of 9k—and divided things so I had 2k in a checking account—and 7k in another money market account—getting 4.5% a year. The 5k from the treasure was separate—untouchable—sacred. I would rather wither on the streets than to use it for something temporary like rent or a grumbling belly—no no no—that treasure had to be used for a good purpose.

A rope snaps at the worst moment. The group learns that even small failures can change fate.

**Focus:**
- Create a crisis of trust (money, the stipend, the treasure's true value).
- Identify a fragile relationship (Patrick and stability; the museum vs survival).
