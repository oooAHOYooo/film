# The Quiet Markets

At the time I was teaching part time at the library—and was waffling to one of my librarian friends who was active in the community—lest she mentioned once that her old roommate used to volunteer at City Seed, a nonprofit organization whose website boasted about—

I was in a season where I thought I would give private teaching a spin—teaching a graphic design course—with the intentions of—. My idea was to teach the children of the local business owners—proper color schemes and contrast and font ratios—so that they could—and stop with the shabby nonsensical graphic design. There needed to be unity—and I figured that one way to unite everyone was to have a similar unifying aspect.

So I wrote an outline of twelve bullet points—and then I numbered them—and then divided it into three. Of that three I developed a three lesson plan. Me, not thinking that I could do anything three days in a row, decided it would be better to parse the class into three weeks—and then pump up the homework. All with the intention of receiving a 2.5k grant from New Haven Connect—and a longshot chance for the child of some bodega owner to house a pretty linographic shop I would see.

I took pictures of all of the storefronts on State Street and contrasted them with signs I found off of Pinterest. Lesson 1: learn good taste by comparing bad shit to good shit. Lesson 2 would be more of exploring tools to make it happen—but first—using something to back up the claim that good artists copy great artists steal. Lesson 3—

Once outside a church on Whitney I stumbled upon an old man named Paul who was taking out recycles in the back of a church on Whitney. I got to talking to him once before at Nica's—and he was a sexton. What's a sexton? asked I? Thinking he was going to tell me about some obscure French derivative of the wind brass instrument—I was surprised to learn that it meant basically a church janitor. Feeling charmed at the grit of the man I asked if he wanted some help.

**Focus:**
- Discover a key resource (City Seed, graphic design course, Paul the sexton).
- Spot someone watching (the librarian, the community).
