**Chapter 37: The Coffee Peddler—Laundry Cafe Idea**

That night I went to bed and juiced up on Google Maps—hoping to scout the Havens and make a bit of a fuss—but I was tired so I decided to go to the Coffee Peddler in the morning. The Coffee Peddler—would be a good place to start—mainly because it was so close to home and I was feeling lazy.

My initial plan was to start with a series of small wins and progressively increase the small wins into small milestones that I would have on some small chart that I'd hang with a magnet on a mini fridge. My morning, at hand, was simple—go into every coffee shop and examine, take notes and steal. I would trek into every single fucking coffee shop in New Haven—and steal—steal ideas—and emulate.

The plan was to plan a trip to each shop—and take notes of all of the things—all things. Unique things—things I dislike—things like a POS system—a refrigerator—ceiling fan—the pretty dangling—Edison bulbs. Things like that I'd write in writing—and later in Excel—and then—when I collect enough data—I'd cross compare and have ChatGPT find me free alternatives to acquire each and every device needed to operate a functional coffee shop.

Business of starting hipster doodle things at diners—but really didn't like the back and forth—the work itself was easy but the communication I couldn't do—I had more things to do—this was supposed to be a system of economic income.

Prototype a laundry machine cafe—for the idea could be viral only if we had a prototype in the backyard. Get a bunch of old laundry machines together—I could have Dominic and the boys pick it up—and then put flyers around town for a potluck cafe laundromat prototype and investor pancake brunch—all in the backyard. Yes. The backyard laundromat cafe.

Currents pull the group off course. The sea is not an enemy—but it refuses to be mastered.

**Focus:**
- Test endurance (the coffee shop recon, the prototype).
- Make space for confession (the back and forth he couldn't do; the dream).
