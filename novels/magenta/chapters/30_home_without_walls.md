# Home Without Walls

**Chapter 50–51: The Beginning of the End—Quit Vapes—Boston**

It was a while since I picked up this notebook and started writing again. And a lot of—

Today I decided to quit the vapes all together. I drove to Planet Fitness then to Walmart—then to pick up my girlfriend and then to drop her off at my apartment as she had to be at a counseling session and I was losing my mind on account of lack of nicotine. Felt a bit like a crack addict among crack heads at the Walmart—I learned that my tell tale sign was that I didn't have a shopping cart. No no—no shopping cart for me. But since living in East Haven I've really come to love the diversity of the coast here in CT—it's amazing what a little salt air and the way the sun hits the water—turning it into melodic waves.

Oh to be nicotine free—my last puff of the vape was this morning at 10am—and then having properly muscled through the first 10 min—checking the clock—silently chalking an invisible chalk—I wondered how anyone could live as to be such a slave to time—thus I gave up around noon. I caved after a couple of days of not smoking. Actually it was a matter of hours. I decided to switch it up and instead of going no nicotine—I decided not to ingest my nicotine via inhaling—instead I bought a snus at the gas station. It felt like hot ice on top of my gums.

Josh and I decided to move in together a couple of months back and so far it's been so good. Though I do miss the house on East Rock. I saw Kenny Lewis once outside of Atticus Market. I decided that it would be better if I found him when I was terribly withdrawing from nicotine—I kept going and moving forward.

**Epilogue: My present plan is to marry my girlfriend—and give this whole town a kiss goodbye.** We were talking about venturing up to Boston—to see if we could make a little splash—wondering if Boston would have an alderman—or any islands to sail to—or would be privy to running a little laundromat cafe. Kenny Lewis and I used to talk about the bar barge—the bar on the barge for ships and weekend champion sailors to.

What does last forever? Certainly not friendship groups among the Havens. I first came to these shores two years back this coming September. And this September it was my last time. I wrote these entries sporadically and out of order—and let my mind fill in the gaps of time when focused—had to do it that way—hopefully the chronicles and time are all set in place.

What was life before the Havens.

**Epilogue—3 years later.**

The Havens are not a fortress but a way of living. The story ends with a new definition of refuge.

**Focus:**
- Close with a thematic statement (home without walls; Boston; marry; kiss goodbye).
- Leave room for continuation (3 years later; what was life before the Havens).
