# Names of the Houses

I began to see the city as a Venn diagram between architecture and vape shops. Liquor stores and lawyers—on billboards, on shopping carts, on buses—everywhere—lawyer this lawyer that. I penned up a plan to make a documentary about the wars—figured it would do well on Netflix—but here we are. Cash for check stores—between Cash App promises next to cathedrals and gargoyles. Beautiful stone work—beautiful Victorian houses upon a hill—next to a run down—albeit Victorian. You would drive up one street—and go to another.

When I would talk about this at pubs and bars I would hear folks and scholars say it was because of gentrification—others because of affordable houses—the most unpopular came from the right—lest in view of the left—was that this was all a result of liquor stores with advertisers—and I was pissed because it was creating a bullshit society. Let the folks have their liquor—but do it in a civilized way—not one that makes them look like rats.

It looks like it was done with clip art. This was an issue I thought everyone could get behind—and perhaps a good lesson to do for my curriculum.

**Focus:**
- Catalog the houses and their roles (State Street, Victorian hills, lawyers, liquor).
- Reveal a hidden rivalry (gentrification vs affordable, signage and graphic design).
