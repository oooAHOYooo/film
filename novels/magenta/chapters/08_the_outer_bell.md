# The Outer Bell

He went on to tell me all about the Tweed Airport—on how parties on both sides of the line are opposed. And then reminded me that I should go check out the birthplace of George Bush. I once Google mapped it and tried to see why—and I figured a solution that would keep the conservatives' tax dollars low—while giving the left's activism something to chew on—something that would make things look civilized—while not gentrifying—a statement on State Street—hopefully something that—if done right—and if done by children—could have everyone put down their pitchforks.

One day at church—old man Paul stopped me to remind me that today was Ronald Reagan's birthday—and asked if I ever visited the house that George Bush grew up in. I didn't. I was expressing to him my concerns of driving in this morning—how it was like playing Frogger with NPCs—and then we talked about the different streets in New Haven. He then told me about the 70s and what folks were concerned about then—it sounded oddly similar—and I put the matter to rest—knowing that I did not want my voice to be muddled in the mix—rather—give the people what they want—and what do they want? Give them what I want? How? Is that narcissistic—perhaps—but I think I have good taste—at least—better taste than some of the tragedy I see within the signage and the graphic design use on State Street.

This was an issue I thought everyone could get behind—and perhaps a good lesson to do for my curriculum.

**Focus:**
- Use the bell as foreshadowing (church, Reagan, Tweed, pitchforks).
- Set the emotional tone (give the people what they want; good taste).
