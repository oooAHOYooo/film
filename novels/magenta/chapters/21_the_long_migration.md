# The Long Migration

The Art of Boat Building. Detailed efforts in designing and constructing the boat—with community members contributing skills and resources.

Setting Sail. The completion of the boat and the launch ceremony—highlighting the support from local politicians who see the value in the friends' endeavor.

Navigating the Waters. The team embarks on their journey—facing natural and man-made challenges as they approach Thimble Island.

I went home that night and scouted my room and stress packed a bag. I couldn't help packing everything I could get my hands on—cards, cables, a dollar store coloring book left over from a kids party, gum, a ruler, scissors, a battery powered fan, bug spray—and I quit when I held a cup of yogurt to the light—wondering if it was bad—I knew I had my fill. Tomorrow was the day if we were going to see if this Boston Whaler float. That night I streamed Seinfeld on the tele and tried to go to bed. I turned over as the blue light was bothering me and opened up the window a bit. Listening to the distant cars and motorbikes and city sounds—I imagined what it would be like to hear waves.

A moving community crosses the path. Their stories mirror the group's pursuit.

**Focus:**
- Show another way to survive (the boat, the crew, the voyage).
- Offer a choice to join or pass (Thimble Island; the treasure).
