# The Trial of Tides

**Chapter 39: On the Day We Opened the Popup—City Climb, Mr Katz**

It was decided that we would not use a cafe at all—even though it would be easier—because then we would only have to worry about the laundry—I didn't want a place. So we decided to use an abandoned place in City Climb—where there were punk rockers found their dwelling upstairs upstairs. There was a vacant space next to the locker room—that used to be some hip hop DJ station—not sure—but everything was covered with maroon when we walked in. I found that I could rent it for 800 dollars a month. It really was a big space—but disgusting.

I inquired if I could have a month to month lease—at least at first—and then after 3 months—be able to sign something—with the promise, to sweeten the pot—that at the 3 month mark—we would pay 1.1k a month—if we decided to stay there. The owner was named Mr Katz—and I never met him—just his secretary—Mr Katz—from what I heard from the great vine—was a true entrepreneur and was one of those men who were involved with Mandy Management—Pike Release—essentially—the modern day equivalent of a slum lord. Looking at his office—I realized that he would lead from the top. No no no—I didn't give a flying kite about that—lest at the moment—City Climb had name recognition and was ripe for marketing.

We put a bunch of signs all over City Climb—and it was grand. We gave ourselves 3 weeks. The first thing we did was clean out the place—I paid Dominic and Sam 50 dollars each to get all the random stuff and take it to the dump—and then Kenny Lewis, Josh and I cleaned the floors and wiped the walls. The next thing I did was paint—I figured some paint could hide a bunch of damage. What was most important was getting the lighting temperature down—so that is what I focused on. When a user were to first walk in—we would convert their dollars into coins—barcade style. Coins worked for several reasons. We would have a minimum entry per guest—20 dollars. 20 dollars of 20 LaundraCoins—could do all types of things.

What was it about the laundry machines—asked Kenny Lewis—that got me so excited. He then pointed out all the ways in which the project would fail.

A final challenge must be faced before the inner gates open. The tide sets a hard limit.

**Focus:**
- Force a decisive action (City Climb, the lease, the coin system).
- Bring the group to unity (Dominic, Sam, Kenny Lewis, Josh).
