# The Shifting Wall

An Unlikely Team. Introduction of a diverse group of friends in New Haven with a shared dream of building a boat for a treasure hunt.

The Blueprint Emerges. Discovery of an old diary hinting at hidden treasure in Thimble Island—inspiring the friends to plan their adventure.

Rallying the Community. The friends navigate local politics to gain support for their project—securing a space in East Haven for boat building.

A wall that moves with the tide closes and opens like a mouth. Passing through it requires timing and courage.

**Focus:**
- Create a physical obstacle (politics, space, the plan itself).
- Show a character's resolve (Patrick assembling the team and the blueprint).
