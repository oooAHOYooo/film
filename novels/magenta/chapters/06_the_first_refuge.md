# The First Refuge

I found an apartment on Saint John's Street. I didn't know the vibes—so I would often walk around outside with headphones on—and look like I was really working hard on a laptop. The best way I'd learned to handle the Havens—without just walking around constantly chit chatting to people—was to put headphones on and look busy.

That small settlement offered temporary shelter. Its rules felt kind—but they were strict for survival. I kept my head down.

**Focus:**
- Show the refuge's customs (headphones, laptop, head down).
- Introduce a boundary that cannot be crossed (don't know the vibes yet).
