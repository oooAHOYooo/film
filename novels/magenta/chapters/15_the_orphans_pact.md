# The Orphan's Pact

**Chapter 19: Discovering Gold with Bobby McArnold**

I was happy to have discovered the gold with Bobby McArnold—but I was wary because he was a blabbermouth—blab blab blab—gossip this—gossip that—drama dram drama—everyone knew it—everyone warned me against him in that regard. Tell Bobby if you want it going on the news.

I was worried that he would tell his father—for he told me he was going to. We both ordered a Reuben at Archie Moore's as I marveled at the design pirate wheel that was pouring my red ale. It came about when he was showing me his old collection of his father's collection from the 80s—and one of them—next to a bunch of other items that seemed to be out of Miami Vice—was a metal detector. I've never seen anything like it.

An outsider offers help—but it comes with a personal vow. The pact binds the group to a new responsibility.

Bobby's father was a theologian and well known around Yale Divinity school. I went to one of his lectures once and felt like the cool celebrity plus one among the men and women who had to earn degrees to get there. But stepping in, I knew that the joke was on me for not having the courage to put my hat in the ring to get earned entrance. But then again, I knew from such friends, that it wasn't all it was cracked up to be - furthermore - the reason I wanted entry was vain - to show others that I belonged at the table.

**Focus:**
- Add a new traveling companion (Bobby McArnold, the metal detector, the gold).
- Raise the cost of failure (Bobby will talk; the father; the news).
