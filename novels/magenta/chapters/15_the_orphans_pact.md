# The Orphan's Pact

**Chapter 19: Discovering Gold with Bobby McArnold**

I was happy to have discovered the gold with Bobby McArnold—but I was wary because he was a blabbermouth—blab blab blab—gossip this—gossip that—drama dram drama—everyone knew it—everyone warned me against him in that regard. Tell Bobby if you want it going on the news.

I was worried that he would tell his father—for he told me he was going to. We both ordered a Reuben at Archie Moore's as I marveled at the design pirate wheel that was pouring my red ale. It came about when he was showing me his old collection of his father's collection from the 80s—and one of them—next to a bunch of other items that seemed to be out of Miami Vice—was a metal detector. I've never seen anything like it.

An outsider offers help—but it comes with a personal vow. The pact binds the group to a new responsibility.

**Focus:**
- Add a new traveling companion (Bobby McArnold, the metal detector, the gold).
- Raise the cost of failure (Bobby will talk; the father; the news).
