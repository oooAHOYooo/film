# The Hidden Harbor

**Negotiations with Uncle Sam.** The authorities express interest in the treasure—leading to negotiations about its fate.

**The Exception.** Thanks to the political goodwill they've garnered—an agreement is reached allowing the friends to keep the treasure under certain conditions.

Can't. Feels illegal. If we turn it in—they're gonna ask how they got it. We're have burying it again—and leave some clues. Passing ordinance—carve something. As the alder—needs to preserve it in the New Haven museum—flesh out.

Alderman thinks he is president. Answers email.

Ending—someone finds the gold.

A harbor is tucked between cliffs. It feels like arrival—but it is not the destination.

**Focus:**
- Provide temporary peace (the deal, the exception).
- Introduce a new threat (illegal, the museum, the ordinance, someone finds the gold).
