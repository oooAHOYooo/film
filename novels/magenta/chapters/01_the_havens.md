# The Havens

The Havens begins here.

That Puppet Show at Three Sheets was something else.

I looked for a way out but I was caught up in the wilderness. I looked at the door but it was crowded. I looked over at the garden of the golden drafts of beer that poured so smooth to the happy lip-ringed hipsters—and I wanted one.

I checked the drink of the day on a chalkboard housed inside a carved painting of a large titty-breasted-tattooed mermaid with a blue beard and a lobster claw for a hand. I did some quick math on local beers and weighed the abv versus their price—and then once that was all sorted out I went for the names I'd never heard of and whispered them out loud. "Whalers" "Two Roads" "East Rock" "Sea Hag" "Armada"—"Sea Hag"—"Sea Hag" Sea Hag. "Aye ye nothing but a lonely Sea Hag!" Done.

Here I stood, on the eve of my 27th birthday—watching a man in his early 40s reading index cards out of a mason jar to a crowd that paid $10 at the door. One card after another he read out loud—variously detailed accounts of his past teenage drama—often using different voices—often using different costumes—often using different props and lighting setups.

The beer was good so I drank another—and then decided to get one more to see if this guy with the index cards was ever going to pull out that puppet—he was reaching for something fuzzy in a tote bag when boom! Jesse Humm walks in. Jesse fucking Humm in the flesh before me. What the fuck?

"Jesse" says I. "Patrick" says Jesse. "What are you doing here?" "I work here." "Yeah, at Three Sheets?" "No, at Yale—I'm a postdoc." "Oh—like post patient treatment?" "No, PostDoc—means I'm in a PhD program." "Oh, nice, congrats man." "What are you doing here?" "I have no idea." "What do you mean?" "I'm just visiting for the night." "Yeah?" "Yeah man—thought New Haven sounded cool." "Really?" "Yeah." "Well, what do you mean?" "Yeah." "Isn't this place great?" "What are you drinking?" "Sea Hag." "Ahh—I don't like that but have you tried the Red Ale?"

Jesse was good enough and the Red Ale wasn't bad either. He soon had to go on account of his friend meeting him somewhere called Gypsy. "Gypsy." "Yeah—it's a subsidized Yale bar for PostDocs and graduates." "Cool." "Cool." "Well, we should really hang out sometime"—said Jesse—"If you ever came back to the Havens—give me a call."

**Focus:**
- Define the rumor of the Havens (Three Sheets, Yale, the coast, "back to the Havens").
- Introduce the narrator's stake in finding them.
