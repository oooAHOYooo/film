The Havens begins here.

Use this chapter as a landing point for your outline, beats, and early prose.

A name with weight, a promise more than a place. The Havens are spoken of like a wind directionâ€”always present, never fully seen.

Focus:
- Define the rumor of the Havens.
- Introduce the narratorâ€™s stake in finding them.
