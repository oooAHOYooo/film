# The Map of Old Rivers

I chalked it up to this little Three Sheets and this little New Haven growing on me—and I began to imagine a nautical homage. Just then the man with the index cards told a story of the sea and a sad boy in New England—and I thought it was a sign. So I stayed.

I went on Zillow and saw a bunch of places off Whalley Ave—which now in hindsight there might have truly been a little guardian angel looking out for me—for I realized, though they are close by on the Google maps, there are no streets that are quite similar in the Havens. I found an apartment on Saint John's Street. I kept my head down. I didn't know the vibes—so I would often walk around outside.

I thought about the coast and was excited to Google map it later—see just how many boats came to this port. I was doing that Google mapping before—and I imagined that this must have been some old sailor's favorite port. Creamy with a navy polo skinny tie—this little town that housed this little Yale had a little nautical bent to it.

**Focus:**
- Record the map's origin (Zillow, Whalley vs St John's, the port).
- Hint that the rivers moved for a reason (guardian angel, streets not quite similar).
