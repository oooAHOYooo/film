# The Open Door

**Chapter 39–40: On the Day We Opened—Everything Worked Out Perfect**

On the day we opened it was cloudy—right before February. For a while it seemed like the weather was wild. Some moments in January provided a winter chill—others—well—others did not. And it was tough for a while. My allergies didn't know how to keep up—but as I blew my nose—I didn't have time to worry about that.

The night before I Pinterest-ed different outfits for opening—I wanted to convey a message that I was of the common man—while still sleek enough for investors to take me seriously.

Everything worked out perfect. Early in the morning there was a line—line out the door. Mostly that were loyal members from the party—which whom I promised free access and breakfast and t-shirts—but they didn't need that. These were my friends. So I then wrote a follow up letter—asking if we could instead give those out to the random strangers—and then in the second batch of supplies.

I enjoyed the fact that this was only once a month—we made 2500 dollars that day. Perhaps we do 2x a month. I didn't want to risk it—and grow depressed—like someone working a deli or a diner—having it open for one weekend a month—the frequency people do laundry in the Haven—freed my mind for other endeavors—and to slowly have this stream of income.

The gate opens. It is not a wall but an invitation that asks who they will become.

**Focus:**
- Resolve the external journey (the popup opens; 2500 dollars).
- Set up inner transformation (once a month; the stream; the risk).
