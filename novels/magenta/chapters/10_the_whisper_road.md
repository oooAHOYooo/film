# The Whisper Road

I asked him if he knew of Griffions—he heard one of his friends did—and he asked if I knew about it—and no.

I liked New Haven—I enjoyed when I would walk out and see random pianos around Audubon—graffitied—not working—I would stop and play the one song I knew—and move on.

A narrow road holds old footsteps. The wind carries rumors that sound like names.

**Focus:**
- Reveal a new guide (Griffions, the French man's crowd, the pianos).
- Introduce a moral test (what does Patrick actually know; what is he here for).
