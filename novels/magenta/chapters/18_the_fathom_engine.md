# The Fathom Engine

**Chapter 22: Getting the Boat—SS Zulu**

Two days turned into 5 days but moves were made. Somehow, someway I found my hands on a handsome but beat up Boston Whaler with the name SS Zulu painted on the side.

I stood outside Action RPG—Dominic's business he ran with his brothers—which stood for, apparently, Roofing, Paving at Great Value. This was neither roofing nor a paving request—instead I wanted them to look at the engine and determine if the bird was good enough for flight. The brothers agreed to help clean up the boat—glue it where it needed to be glued—and doze it with a fresh coat of extra paint.

I watched the brothers as they danced about in harmony—I stepped back and entered the back of the mind and minded all of the other moving pieces in play. I checked each individual status of 10 second-hand metal detectors and I wondered if I had calculated the fact that some may need new batteries. How long are we scanning the sand?

Dominic wanted to know what was the payout if we found the gold—I told him the truth—10 percent per member of this party. Dominic took a second and did some math—"so where does the remaining 20 go?" "I figured we could put it in a fund to fuel more expeditions—that or we'll just buy some bitcoin and separate that another eight ways." replied I. "Fake gold for real gold? That's wild—wild wild wild—World's gone wild Davey."

Dominic put the bucket down and walked over to a makeshift fridge he had next to the portable bathroom station—he reached in and grabbed four Dr. Thunders. "I don't know about that Davey—I gotta check with my uncles about that." He passed a Thunder to me—I cracked it.

A relic meant to measure depth begins to malfunction. The readings grow impossible.

**Focus:**
- Introduce a mysterious device (the boat, the engine, the metal detectors).
- Suggest the world is changing (bitcoin, Dr. Thunder, the uncles).
