# The Covenant Stone

**A Historic Discovery.** The friends uncover the treasure—which includes artifacts of significant cultural and historical value.

I spent a lot of time googling—the history of Thimble Island treasure—and after the first result came up as *In 1699, the pirate Capt. William Kidd had treasure buried on Gardiners Island, the private island located between the Twin Forks. It's a true story, but the fact is that Kidd never did it. Instead, he got the owner of the island, Jonathan Gardiner, to bury it somewhere secret on the island.*—I was hooked.

Knowing that Kenny Lewis wouldn't pull the trigger—knowing that momentum would soon fade—and knowing that Bobby McArnold would eventually talk himself out of it—I decided that here—right now—this right present moment—this in the day the Lord has made—I shall assemble a team and see for certain—if there were any additional treasure.

The treasure hunting business is not for the faint of heart. Nor the feint.

That night I stared at the ceiling—and began to write names on blank index cards.

A stone marks a promise made generations ago. It is both map and memorial.

**Focus:**
- Ground the myth in history (Kidd, Gardiner, the treasure).
- Reveal the original oath (the team, the index cards, the covenant).
