# The Oath on the Bridge

So I moved. I bloody got my sugar up one day and moved. Those tales of my past are long documented and need no account here for such endeavors.

As time moved on I wrote down on a piece of paper: *New Haven is the place—riddled with opportunities—craziness—and people from around the world.*

Back to the Havens—back to the Havens—what did that mean. I had no idea—but I stayed.

**Focus:**
- Bind two characters together (Patrick and the city; the vow to stay).
- Define the crossing as irreversible (the move).
