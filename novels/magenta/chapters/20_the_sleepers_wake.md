# The Sleeper's Wake

**Chapter 23: That Time We Found the Treasure**

It was a warm Saturday morning—the kind of June day that made you forget that you are writing this in the cold—that there ever was such a thing as winter.

Yada yada yada—I was up and showered—in the shower I privately talked to myself and vaped and vaped—I was nervous—this was the day—how was I doing emotionally? Living in the moment of it—I trained for this moment—but didn't give myself a lot of time to think. I marched.

I went downstairs—Kenny Lewis was cleaning up the plates and in front of me—on a happy birthday plate—

Snacks. Snacks. Snacks. Someone with a map. Research how to find treasure in sand.

It was cold on the day we embarked. A bit of fog went up the Long Island Sound—we all awoke and Bobby McArnold was making breakfast—something he was talking about for a couple of days now.

A figure wakes after a long illness and speaks of the Havens in riddles. Their memory is partial—but urgent.

**Focus:**
- Drop a cryptic warning (the plate, the snacks, the day).
- Spark an argument (breakfast, the crew, the fog).
