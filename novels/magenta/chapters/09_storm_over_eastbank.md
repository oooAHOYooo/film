**Chapter 7: Meeting the French Man**

Alexis Sardine was in America and studying at Yale—but what amazed me was how badly he loved it here. He was French but from Argentina and lived in Brazil—he was born in Argentina—and I had somehow become the arbiter of truth for all things America. He would ask me questions about New Haven—and I wouldn't know the answer—or what to say—and I would ask him questions about Argentina and France—and he did in fact know what to say—which was bothersome.

He was on a master in data science—and that meant that he was just going to be doing his physics here—he would not be attending any classes—or have the normal—he was here to complete a masters—which meant some lab meetings—private work—and I, being a sole web developer, wanted the company—agreed to see if we wanted to cowork one day.

We didn't really—we met outside on a September day outside of Chapel at Book Trader Cafe. He had a little espresso black—and I had a large iced latte with apple cider flavor. I knew that it was a little early for pumpkin—but I was excited. He was asking about the American fall—and all that it accompanied.

**Focus:**
- Derail the original plan (coworking becomes something else).
- Force a harder path (the French man knows more than Patrick; New Haven as question mark).
