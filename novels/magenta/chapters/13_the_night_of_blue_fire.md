# The Night of Blue Fire

**Chapter 18: Transition Scene—Leaving Office—Finding Time for New Things—New Hope of What to Do as a Free Citizen—a Regular Private Person.**

Part 2: The Treasure of Thimble Island.

A rare phenomenon lights the water. It is beautiful and dangerous—a sign to the faithful. I was wrecked—havoc of the 20s whirlwind. But were there pitchforks—I would often wonder as I scrolled around Twitter—is Twitter the arbiter of the cornerstone of our society? I am not sure—because when I walk around—no one says shit. Lot of darting eyes—no one says anything. Unless at the elder old lady at the bread shops.

**Focus:**
- Use the blue fire as omen (vape, chaos, transition, treasure).
- Mark a turning point (leaving office; the dream of the treasure hunt).
