# The Salt Garden

**Chapter 20–21: The Start of the Treasure Hunt / The Prep**

By and by, as the days grew—so did Kenny Lewis's thoughts. Kenny Lewis didn't care about the wealth or the acclaim—no—nor was he pressed by grandeur or self acclaim—lest at first—no—what Kenny Lewis really wanted—what he needed—was the adventure—the chance to use his gadgets among his friends. The chance to use all of these random ass applied skills that he had been mustering—and the chance to do something great with his life. Dude was almost 37 and still living in a frat-like townhouse—maybe we kept him young—maybe he was comfortable—that must be it—frat type environment. Lest on paper he never told me any of this—but I deducted such as much.

And I really wanted that too—some sense of adventure—the Havens were becoming dull—I wanted something to do—something to call my own—something that would somehow someway combine such existential dread into something useful and practical. Working as an Alderman wasn't as all consuming as I initially hoped it would be—and I needed something. I knew that I didn't know how finding a gold coin by Thimble Island would accomplish that—but we marched forward with the plan.

Knowing that Kenny Lewis would never take action about the coin. Knowing that he would keep it in his room and that it would eventually end up in a drawer somewhere—between a portable solar panel and some HDMI converter. No—no, Kenny Lewis would never do it.

So the next morning—as I was outside watching the birds swivel and hunt and as the breeze carried a taste of salt air—I spotted a seagull and pondered at my personal pity party. Another seagull caught my eye and I realized that I was in New Haven, Connecticut—in the cusp of the 21st century—among the roaring 20s. I had a couple of years left before anyone would bat an eye of such antics—thus I deemed it necessary to assemble such a crew and hunt for treasure.

So thus—I lit a cowboy killer—and watched the smoke flutter among the budding spring leaves.

On a piece of yellow pad paper—with a purple crayon I found on the grass near the trash—I wrote:

Get Someone with a boat. Get Someone who knows how to use boat. Someone who knew where to look—based on maps and such. Someone to help us take the raw materials off the island—into the boat—transport it from Branford to Bethany and make some route along 95. Someone to help with security measures. Someone to help with snacks the day of.

I pinned up the first two items as things to worry about later. What I was most interested in was someone who knew how to read maps—and the only person I associated with maps was an elderly librarian woman I befriended while working out of the library—Sandra Miller. Sandra once showed me a collection of New Haven maps. Perhaps she had one of the Thimble Islands.

I figured I needed to figure out how to take off work for a couple of days. Being a freelancer means no one is your boss—many people are your boss. So I googled best way to let people know to back off and I settled upon an automatic email reply—saying that I would be out of office until next Monday. I let it slide until the following because I didn't want to jump into something just yet. But the system worked and I'd be able to pull the trigger when ready.

I drove to the Planet Fitness—didn't want to go off the one off of Whalley as it was too naff and gangster for my taste—I heard that Gonz got mugged outside his apartment and since then had been wary of hanging around big empty parking lots during some choice neighborhoods at night. Fuck what I'm supposed to think—I wasn't having it. So I drove on the coast along 142 and ended up in East Haven—after realizing that Hamden doesn't have a Planet Fitness at all. And I—at 10:30 in my clogs after a month of solid eating horribly—came back to the gym and did 32 bench presses with light weight. I thought about all the ways I've and things I've done except working out—and pitied myself—wondering why I'd get so far gone.

I did two more sets and then texted ideas on my phone. I was having a good old fashion pity party about the whole endeavor and had to reach deep down—after 2 sets—I felt like I could do anything.

Kenny Lewis is the man—and I this would be good for him. Everyone needs adventure—don't they? And this seems to be pretty low hanging fruit—something useful to stress about—something that would get the mind in the positive direction. It'll take heart—determination and careful planning.

A lot of that courage fizzled as I hit the incline bench—think I was doing it wrong and felt the pains in my shoulders a bit.

What was the point of a treasure hunt? For some odd reason I was fully convinced and a gut feeling that we would find massive gold there—and that the alderman thing—

The other problem we faced early on was detection. I didn't know the legalities exactly—so I wrote a note to be sure to consult with my friend Brenn—who was some hot shot law student out of Quinnipiac who had a chip on his shoulder that he wasn't studying at Yale—but lived in East Rock nonetheless.

The first order of business was to assemble a time and place to meet. Least to myself—I needed to feel the reassurance of having something planned and prepared beforehand—I would settle on meeting in the backwoods of Krauser's—but wanted to lavish the troops. So I decided that the rooftop of Elm City Social fit the bill—but when I called to inquire—they informed me that the rooftop won't be open until after Labor Day—around 72 days away I told the bartender—"if that's the right math—then yes"—"Okay," said I—"I'll hold you to it then."

I walked around my room a bit—and found some frozen dumplings in the freezer. And I was finishing them up outside—I imagined what this backyard would be like in the summer—and drifted off into la la land.

I became overwhelmed. Overwhelmed that I had all this work to do. Overwhelmed that I had all of these ideas but no one to share them with. No partner—nothing but the moon. And it was in that weird eye looking moon that just makes one feel like they're up to something evil.

But aye—I recognized this voice—this internal little moth of a rat—and I did 16 pushups to spite it. And immediately after the set—sporadically cleaned my room and did 16 more. And took a vow to the moon that I would do ten sets that day from now on.

Fuck this.

I started googling images on Pinterest of boats and treasure hunts and filled my screen with childhood imagery I long forgot.

I started an email thread—but then worried that no one would check their email—so I started a GroupMe group chat—but then felt that such a move was too European and I wanted to settle on American communication. So I landed on an SMS group chat and praised God that to my surprise—everyone had an iPhone—and I could drag and drop documents from my computer.

We settled upon Elm City Social—but I had to revamp the plans as they were not open until Labor Day.

I watched the wind play with the leaves against the neighbor's fire escape and tried to visualize what this treasure hunt might look like. Considering my list—I considered how much to allot to this effort—and decided to double down on the delusion—setting a budget for $225 dollars would sufficiently aid the crazy—such a low budget—perhaps would spark a heaven of volunteerism—lest creative activity. I lit another heater. It was 9:37pm and I had already checked my email, my telegram, my WhatsApp, my Insta—several times. Click by click the treasure hunt grew smaller—and the idea, delusional. Click by click I grew okay with my cowardice—justifying that little fearful voice was really an angel whispering that this is all but a fairytale—that the treasure hunt is absurd—that time will be wasted and the work will be dissolved into vanity. That the town would find out about my efforts and call me insane.

I cracked my neck and did 16 pushups. I ran to the bathroom—took a hard look and slapped myself so hard that my olive skin turned red. It was time to step it up and quit being a little bitch. I wrote a list of people to call.

A place where the sea is harvested like a crop. It is quiet—and the silence teaches patience.

**Focus:**
- Slow the pace with reflection (the list, the budget, the slap, the moon).
- Hide a clue in the stillness (Sandra Miller, the maps, the purple crayon, Brenn).
