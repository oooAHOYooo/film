# The Havens

The Havens begins here.

That Puppet Show at Three Sheets was something else.

I looked for a way out but I was caught up in the wilderness. I looked at the door but it was crowded. I looked over at the garden of the golden drafts of beer that poured so smooth to the happy lip-ringed hipsters—and I wanted one.

I checked the drink of the day on a chalkboard housed inside a carved painting of a large titty-breasted-tattooed mermaid with a blue beard and a lobster claw for a hand. I did some quick math on local beers and weighed the abv versus their price—and then once that was all sorted out I went for the names I'd never heard of and whispered them out loud. "Whalers" "Two Roads" "East Rock" "Sea Hag" "Armada"—"Sea Hag"—"Sea Hag" Sea Hag. "Aye ye nothing but a lonely Sea Hag!" Done.

Here I stood, on the eve of my 27th birthday—watching a man in his early 40s reading index cards out of a mason jar to a crowd that paid $10 at the door. One card after another he read out loud—variously detailed accounts of his past teenage drama—often using different voices—often using different costumes—often using different props and lighting setups.

The beer was good so I drank another—and then decided to get one more to see if this guy with the index cards was ever going to pull out that puppet—he was reaching for something fuzzy in a tote bag when boom! Jesse Humm walks in. Jesse fucking Humm in the flesh before me. What the fuck?

"Jesse" says I. "Patrick" says Jesse. "What are you doing here?" "I work here." "Yeah, at Three Sheets?" "No, at Yale—I'm a postdoc." "Oh—like post patient treatment?" "No, PostDoc—means I'm in a PhD program." "Oh, nice, congrats man." "What are you doing here?" "I have no idea." "What do you mean?" "I'm just visiting for the night." "Yeah?" "Yeah man—thought New Haven sounded cool." "Really?" "Yeah." "Well, what do you mean?" "Yeah." "Isn't this place great?" "What are you drinking?" "Sea Hag." "Ahh—I don't like that but have you tried the Red Ale?"

Jesse was good enough and the Red Ale wasn't bad either. He soon had to go on account of his friend meeting him somewhere called Gypsy. "Gypsy." "Yeah—it's a subsidized Yale bar for PostDocs and graduates." "Cool." "Cool." "Well, we should really hang out sometime"—said Jesse—"If you ever came back to the Havens—give me a call."

**Focus:**
- Define the rumor of the Havens (Three Sheets, Yale, the coast, "back to the Havens").
- Introduce the narrator's stake in finding them.

### Chapter 2: The Map of Old Rivers

*ACT I — The Map | ID: the_map_of_old_rivers | File: 02_the_map_of_old_rivers.md*

---

# The Map of Old Rivers

I chalked it up to this little Three Sheets and this little New Haven growing on me—and I began to imagine a nautical homage. Just then the man with the index cards told a story of the sea and a sad boy in New England—and I thought it was a sign. So I stayed.

I went on Zillow and saw a bunch of places off Whalley Ave—which now in hindsight there might have truly been a little guardian angel looking out for me—for I realized, though they are close by on the Google maps, there are no streets that are quite similar in the Havens. I found an apartment on Saint John's Street. I kept my head down. I didn't know the vibes—so I would often walk around outside.

I thought about the coast and was excited to Google map it later—see just how many boats came to this port. I was doing that Google mapping before—and I imagined that this must have been some old sailor's favorite port. Creamy with a navy polo skinny tie—this little town that housed this little Yale had a little nautical bent to it.

**Focus:**
- Record the map's origin (Zillow, Whalley vs St John's, the port).
- Hint that the rivers moved for a reason (guardian angel, streets not quite similar).

### Chapter 3: The Festival of Gate Lanterns

*ACT I — The Map | ID: the_festival_of_gate_lanterns | File: 03_the_festival_of_gate_lanterns.md*

---

# The Festival of Gate Lanterns

I enjoyed the nautical homage—and the 2 for $11 Sea Hag deal—the hag hands they called it—perhaps got carried away.

I told him that if I ever got to the place in my life where I felt I needed to read index cards out loud to strangers—I would go as "The Sea Hag."

The next couple of days were a lot of back and forth strip malls and dollar trees—I realized that I might have picked up too much Tupperware—but didn't care. I went to a park called Wooster Park and marveled at all of the different brick work—and all of the different parks—and all of the dogs and the leashes and everyone in between. There were walks of every life in this bunch—blends of Crayola crayons—but the boxes were different—much different.

The next act was decent. The music started. This dude had a synthesizer plugged into a mini amp that he used triple A batteries with aluminum foil to turn them into double A batteries—and took his damn time on the whammy. But I went home that night a little defeated.

**Focus:**
- Show the town's tradition (index cards, hag hands, Wooster Park, brick work).
- Seed the cost of failure (went home defeated).

### Chapter 4: The Oath on the Bridge

*ACT I — The Map | ID: the_oath_on_the_bridge | File: 04_the_oath_on_the_bridge.md*

---

# The Oath on the Bridge

So I moved. I bloody got my sugar up one day and moved. Those tales of my past are long documented and need no account here for such endeavors.

As time moved on I wrote down on a piece of paper: *New Haven is the place—riddled with opportunities—craziness—and people from around the world.*

Back to the Havens—back to the Havens—what did that mean. I had no idea—but I stayed.

**Focus:**
- Bind two characters together (Patrick and the city; the vow to stay).
- Define the crossing as irreversible (the move).

### Chapter 5: Names of the Houses

*ACT I — The Map | ID: names_of_the_houses | File: 05_names_of_the_houses.md*

---

# Names of the Houses

I began to see the city as a Venn diagram between architecture and vape shops. Liquor stores and lawyers—on billboards, on shopping carts, on buses—everywhere—lawyer this lawyer that. I penned up a plan to make a documentary about the wars—figured it would do well on Netflix—but here we are. Cash for check stores—between Cash App promises next to cathedrals and gargoyles. Beautiful stone work—beautiful Victorian houses upon a hill—next to a run down—albeit Victorian. You would drive up one street—and go to another.

When I would talk about this at pubs and bars I would hear folks and scholars say it was because of gentrification—others because of affordable houses—the most unpopular came from the right—lest in view of the left—was that this was all a result of liquor stores with advertisers—and I was pissed because it was creating a bullshit society. Let the folks have their liquor—but do it in a civilized way—not one that makes them look like rats.

It looks like it was done with clip art. This was an issue I thought everyone could get behind—and perhaps a good lesson to do for my curriculum.

**Focus:**
- Catalog the houses and their roles (State Street, Victorian hills, lawyers, liquor).
- Reveal a hidden rivalry (gentrification vs affordable, signage and graphic design).

### Chapter 6: The First Refuge

*ACT I — The Map | ID: the_first_refuge | File: 06_the_first_refuge.md*

---

# The First Refuge

I found an apartment on Saint John's Street. I didn't know the vibes—so I would often walk around outside with headphones on—and look like I was really working hard on a laptop. The best way I'd learned to handle the Havens—without just walking around constantly chit chatting to people—was to put headphones on and look busy.

That small settlement offered temporary shelter. Its rules felt kind—but they were strict for survival. I kept my head down.

**Focus:**
- Show the refuge's customs (headphones, laptop, head down).
- Introduce a boundary that cannot be crossed (don't know the vibes yet).

### Chapter 7: The Quiet Markets

*ACT I — The Map | ID: the_quiet_markets | File: 07_the_quiet_markets.md*

# The Quiet Markets

At the time I was teaching part time at the library—and was waffling to one of my librarian friends who was active in the community—lest she mentioned once that her old roommate used to volunteer at City Seed, a nonprofit organization whose website boasted about—

I was in a season where I thought I would give private teaching a spin—teaching a graphic design course—with the intentions of—. My idea was to teach the children of the local business owners—proper color schemes and contrast and font ratios—so that they could—and stop with the shabby nonsensical graphic design. There needed to be unity—and I figured that one way to unite everyone was to have a similar unifying aspect.

So I wrote an outline of twelve bullet points—and then I numbered them—and then divided it into three. Of that three I developed a three lesson plan. Me, not thinking that I could do anything three days in a row, decided it would be better to parse the class into three weeks—and then pump up the homework. All with the intention of receiving a 2.5k grant from New Haven Connect—and a longshot chance for the child of some bodega owner to house a pretty linographic shop I would see.

I took pictures of all of the storefronts on State Street and contrasted them with signs I found off of Pinterest. Lesson 1: learn good taste by comparing bad shit to good shit. Lesson 2 would be more of exploring tools to make it happen—but first—using something to back up the claim that good artists copy great artists steal. Lesson 3—

Once outside a church on Whitney I stumbled upon an old man named Paul who was taking out recycles in the back of a church on Whitney. I got to talking to him once before at Nica's—and he was a sexton. What's a sexton? asked I? Thinking he was going to tell me about some obscure French derivative of the wind brass instrument—I was surprised to learn that it meant basically a church janitor. Feeling charmed at the grit of the man I asked if he wanted some help.

**Focus:**
- Discover a key resource (City Seed, graphic design course, Paul the sexton).
- Spot someone watching (the librarian, the community).

### Chapter 8: The Outer Bell

*ACT I — The Map | ID: the_outer_bell | File: 08_the_outer_bell.md*

---

# The Outer Bell

He went on to tell me all about the Tweed Airport—on how parties on both sides of the line are opposed. And then reminded me that I should go check out the birthplace of George Bush. I once Google mapped it and tried to see why—and I figured a solution that would keep the conservatives' tax dollars low—while giving the left's activism something to chew on—something that would make things look civilized—while not gentrifying—a statement on State Street—hopefully something that—if done right—and if done by children—could have everyone put down their pitchforks.

One day at church—old man Paul stopped me to remind me that today was Ronald Reagan's birthday—and asked if I ever visited the house that George Bush grew up in. I didn't. I was expressing to him my concerns of driving in this morning—how it was like playing Frogger with NPCs—and then we talked about the different streets in New Haven. He then told me about the 70s and what folks were concerned about then—it sounded oddly similar—and I put the matter to rest—knowing that I did not want my voice to be muddled in the mix—rather—give the people what they want—and what do they want? Give them what I want? How? Is that narcissistic—perhaps—but I think I have good taste—at least—better taste than some of the tragedy I see within the signage and the graphic design use on State Street.

This was an issue I thought everyone could get behind—and perhaps a good lesson to do for my curriculum.

**Focus:**
- Use the bell as foreshadowing (church, Reagan, Tweed, pitchforks).
- Set the emotional tone (give the people what they want; good taste).

# Storm Over Eastbank

**Chapter 7: Meeting the French Man**

Alexis Sardine was in America and studying at Yale—but what amazed me was how badly he loved it here. He was French but from Argentina and lived in Brazil—he was born in Argentina—and I had somehow become the arbiter of truth for all things America. He would ask me questions about New Haven—and I wouldn't know the answer—or what to say—and I would ask him questions about Argentina and France—and he did in fact know what to say—which was bothersome.

He was on a master in data science—and that meant that he was just going to be doing his physics here—he would not be attending any classes—or have the normal—he was here to complete a masters—which meant some lab meetings—private work—and I, being a sole web developer, wanted the company—agreed to see if we wanted to cowork one day.

We didn't really—we met outside on a September day outside of Chapel at Book Trader Cafe. He had a little espresso black—and I had a large iced latte with apple cider flavor. I knew that it was a little early for pumpkin—but I was excited. He was asking about the American fall—and all that it accompanied.

**Focus:**
- Derail the original plan (coworking becomes something else).
- Force a harder path (the French man knows more than Patrick; New Haven as question mark).

### Chapter 10: The Whisper Road

*ACT II — The Crossing | ID: the_whisper_road | File: 10_the_whisper_road.md*

---

# The Whisper Road

I asked him if he knew of Griffions—he heard one of his friends did—and he asked if I knew about it—and no.

I liked New Haven—I enjoyed when I would walk out and see random pianos around Audubon—graffitied—not working—I would stop and play the one song I knew—and move on.

A narrow road holds old footsteps. The wind carries rumors that sound like names.

**Focus:**
- Reveal a new guide (Griffions, the French man's crowd, the pianos).
- Introduce a moral test (what does Patrick actually know; what is he here for).

### Chapter 11: The Archivistâ€™s Rule

*ACT II — The Crossing | ID: the_archivists_rule | File: 11_the_archivists_rule.md*

# The Archivist's Rule

**Chapter 6: Moving to the New House**

I was living with 3 guys from Yale. They played Catan—they were obnoxious and dirty and rude. Living there was hell and not worth mentioning more. It gave me a strong distaste for the lack of styles of men. And there was many a night I Pinterest-ed classical art via men to establish my sanity and hope for the future.

Then I—after visiting church one time—went and moved into a house with Josh, Kenny Lewis, and myself—the 4th was always revolving—and we liked it that way—lest I did at first—Kenny Lewis was upset at the filament.

A keeper of records demands a story in exchange for a passage. Memory becomes currency.

**Focus:**
- Trade a truth for access (church, new house, Josh and Kenny Lewis).
- Expose a past wound (the Yale guys, hell, the filament).

### Chapter 12: Letters From the North

# Letters From the North

**Chapter 14: How I Became an Alderman**

I remember seeing some post on Instagram about the alderman elect—recognizing it was the cute girl from the farmers market I decided to peer further into it. Alderman. I then—looking at the farmers market—ventured to go see about some—

A bundle of letters arrives too late. The messages reframe everything the group believed.

**Focus:**
- Change the stakes (Patrick enters politics).
- Add urgency to the journey (farmers market, the cute girl, the post).

### Chapter 13: The Night of Blue Fire

*ACT II — The Crossing | ID: the_night_of_blue_fire | File: 13_the_night_of_blue_fire.md*

---

# The Night of Blue Fire

**Chapter 18: Transition Scene—Leaving Office—Finding Time for New Things—New Hope of What to Do as a Free Citizen—a Regular Private Person.**

Part 2: The Treasure of Thimble Island.

A rare phenomenon lights the water. It is beautiful and dangerous—a sign to the faithful. I was wrecked—havoc of the 20s whirlwind. But were there pitchforks—I would often wonder as I scrolled around Twitter—is Twitter the arbiter of the cornerstone of our society? I am not sure—because when I walk around—no one says shit. Lot of darting eyes—no one says anything. Unless at the elder old lady at the bread shops.

**Focus:**
- Use the blue fire as omen (vape, chaos, transition, treasure).
- Mark a turning point (leaving office; the dream of the treasure hunt).

### Chapter 14: The Shifting Wall

*ACT II — The Crossing | ID: the_shifting_wall | File: 14_the_shifting_wall.md*

---

# The Shifting Wall

An Unlikely Team. Introduction of a diverse group of friends in New Haven with a shared dream of building a boat for a treasure hunt.

The Blueprint Emerges. Discovery of an old diary hinting at hidden treasure in Thimble Island—inspiring the friends to plan their adventure.

Rallying the Community. The friends navigate local politics to gain support for their project—securing a space in East Haven for boat building.

A wall that moves with the tide closes and opens like a mouth. Passing through it requires timing and courage.

**Focus:**
- Create a physical obstacle (politics, space, the plan itself).
- Show a character's resolve (Patrick assembling the team and the blueprint).

### Chapter 15: The Orphanâ€™s Pact

*ACT II — The Crossing | ID: the_orphans_pact | File: 15_the_orphans_pact.md*

# The Orphan's Pact

**Chapter 19: Discovering Gold with Bobby McArnold**

I was happy to have discovered the gold with Bobby McArnold—but I was wary because he was a blabbermouth—blab blab blab—gossip this—gossip that—drama dram drama—everyone knew it—everyone warned me against him in that regard. Tell Bobby if you want it going on the news.

I was worried that he would tell his father—for he told me he was going to. We both ordered a Reuben at Archie Moore's as I marveled at the design pirate wheel that was pouring my red ale. It came about when he was showing me his old collection of his father's collection from the 80s—and one of them—next to a bunch of other items that seemed to be out of Miami Vice—was a metal detector. I've never seen anything like it.

An outsider offers help—but it comes with a personal vow. The pact binds the group to a new responsibility.

**Focus:**
- Add a new traveling companion (Bobby McArnold, the metal detector, the gold).
- Raise the cost of failure (Bobby will talk; the father; the news).

### Chapter 16: The Council of Mariners

---

# The Council of Mariners

**Chapter 20: The Unlikely Team—The Start of the Treasure Hunt**

By and by the days grew—and I thought about the gold. I wondered what it was like to be Captain Kidd—I'd heard of his name but seldom looked him up—I didn't want to—for in my mind it was romantic with the name—and I was wary the deeper I dove the more it'd beat me up—let not my right hand know what the left was doing and this would stop before it started.

I read or heard or thought once—that to help with the habit of judgement—it is best to think of everyone as a sad little kid trying their best—so I did—I thought of Kenny Lewis as a child with his mom working late—him being in the corner at recess working on a lego robotic—only to have some insecure girl walk over and spill milk on the fat kid—that poor big belly bearded man must have been like as a child. And I realized that he just wanted an opportunity to feel smart and to use his extreme common sense in a passionate way—but he would himself never take any action because he was cursed with the mindset—that many share—that neither knows any kind of progress because they find holes in the plan. Fuck them—but fuck it—I needed him—thought it'd be best to use him as a way to find holes in the boat.

I thought it'd be best if we do a group picture before and after the gold and have a calendar as to prove to the future generations we saw this. Stories for the grandkids—would be the slogan.

---

The next day we met outside gCafe on Orange Street near Trinity. We went over to the bar but discovered that it wasn't open until 3pm or so—so we made quick work of the outside benches.

Together we were Kenny Lewis, Sandra the Librarian, Dominic the Gypsy who couldn't today—Dave Gunn—and Lauren Bird—a girl I tutored in computer science a couple of summers ago.

We were a small group—but we were handsome. I also liked the number of the group. 5. 5 people. 6 including myself. 5 to keep things odd. 5 to keep things honest if there was a vote and a potential for disagreement. Yet I didn't foresee any such.

I handed everyone the sheet of paper and they glanced over it. Kenny Lewis held the sheet and looked unimpressed.

"What's this about heading off to Dave's caddymaster friend?"

"It's a jumping off point," said I—"someone should take notes and start collecting all of our jumping off points."

"I can," said Sandra.

And just like that the meeting began.

"Thank you all for joining—I wrote a little docket to help keep us honest and keep the momentum going. I expect that there are going to be some questions"—I looked at Kenny Lewis in jest—"But I hope that this meeting we can tune them up."

"I appreciate you all making the time for this—I hope to embark on a long journey with you all and come out of the other side of it a renewed and more retrospective person."

Kenny Lewis sighed.

"But presently, I only have about 45 minutes until I have to catch a zoom call for work—so today will be brief."

I continued.

"You can see that I made a little one pager for you fine folk—a scattering of ideas I wrote while shaving this morning on a notepad—and compiled them into a one page format during lunch. Thus please, and kindly, disregard the shoddy format—but I figured it be best to share. Oh and also, I believe I shared them all to your Google Drive—sans Mr. Dave Gunn—who uses Yahoo."

"Still holding strong," replied Gunn.

"You can see I composed everything into a list format and created a basic outline of what it would take to engage in such an endeavor—Now—I never had any time to compile this—so I used ChatGPT to compile a list—actually did well on its first try."

"Great—so you haven't done any work then?" replied Kenny Lewis.

"AI is a tool," replied I. "What do you want me to take 3 hours and copy and paste blog articles? What does it matter? I did work—I prompted it. Peppered it. Whatever."

I took a deep breath and took a sip of coffee.

"Let's start with line item 1."

I began to read.

"Research and Planning: Begin by researching the treasure hunt location or theme. Gather information about any clues, riddles, or historical context associated with the treasure. Plan out the logistics, such as transportation, accommodations, and duration of the hunt."

"Okay so—maybe we pin this one up for now—as it will prompt longer conversations. For brevity—let's move on to Item 2: Gather a Team: Decide if you want to undertake the treasure hunt alone or with a group. If you choose a team, recruit friends or family members who share your enthusiasm and have complementary skills."

"Okay nice—well we can cross this item off—look around—this is the team."

Everyone awkwardly glanced at each other and smiled.

"Line Item 3—Equipment Checklist: Create a checklist of essential equipment you might need during the treasure hunt. This may include a map, compass, GPS device, flashlights, batteries, notepad and pen, camera, magnifying glass, shovel, and other tools based on the nature of the hunt."

"I thought we were running out of time—that you had only 45 minutes—well it's like 35 left now—do you really want to read each one of these out?" snarked Kenny.

Dave Gunn chuckled—Sandra scribbled something on her page. I was losing them.

"Alright fine—Mr. Lewis is right—I'll read just the titles of each line item—and we can decide which one we can use this meeting to talk about… Sandra—are you cool to take some action items based on what we talk about?"

"I can try."

"Thank you Sandra… Okay—Lines 3 through 10: Equipment Checklist. Physical Fitness. Navigation Skills. Problem Solving and Riddles. Safety Measures. Dress Appropriately. Food and Water. Mental Preparation."

"Do we know what we want to talk about now?"

Dave Gunn smiled and looked. "I'd like to talk about navigation skills… Where exactly are we navigating?"

"To Thimble Islands," replied I.

"So like, yeah, but what does that involve? What kind of navigating are we talking about?"

"That's a good question… Kenny, what do you think?"

"Get a boat and sail? Idk," replied Kenny in jest.

"I mean, I know how to sail—and my caddy master has a boat," replied Dave.

"Do you think he would let us use it?" asked I.

"I can check. I guess." Dave took a breath. "It would be kind of weird though. Not really sure what I'd say."

"Lauren, do you mind looking up how much a boat costs on Facebook Marketplace? Sandra—please write in the action items of the meeting notes—decide upon navigation."

Lauren Bird gave me a salute.

"Why do we need a boat at all?" asked Kenny Lewis.

"What are you talking about?—how are we going to get to that island?"

"Well first, which island are you talking about. And second—we could just kayak."

"Kayak with a lot of gold? You Mr. Physics out of us all should know that we can't."

"Kayaks can hold up to 600 pounds. I don't think any of us are over 200 pounds."

"Well Dominic," I said under my breath.

"Even Dominic—if he was 300 pounds—that's still 300 pounds left over—do you think we're going to find more than 300 pounds of gold?"

"That's a good point."

Kenny continued. "The coin I found was around 2 ounces." "Which is great." "Well."

"I like the boat because it implies that we have great ambition. Doesn't seem to have much as a kayak."

Kenny Lewis was visibly getting upset.

"Okay—let's move on."

"Sandra—is there anything on this list that you would like to talk about? Any sort of leads or brainstorms?"

"Maybe the Food and Water?"

"Sure—that's a fun one to talk about."

"How long are we going to go for?" asked Dave.

"Probably around 7 hours total."

Someone looked around—I can head to Costco.

On the way home I met with Gonz outside the P&M—he was on a walk and was carrying a skateboard. He had a six pack of Sea Hags and asked if I'd like to join. Had to.

He asked me how it was to be an alderman. I knew not to tell him too much of the treasure—I think he'd run away with the idea—but I didn't know really what to make of him. I never have seen him in the same outfit twice and mainly reliant on what others say about him. This was the king? thought I—this dispelled—

Sailors and navigators argue over routes. Their debates reveal a fracture in the old order.

**Focus:**
- Expose political tension (Kenny's holes, boat vs kayak, the meeting).
- Choose a risky route (the treasure hunt; the crew; gCafe; Gonz).

### Chapter 17: The Salt Garden

# The Salt Garden

**Chapter 20–21: The Start of the Treasure Hunt / The Prep**

By and by, as the days grew—so did Kenny Lewis's thoughts. Kenny Lewis didn't care about the wealth or the acclaim—no—nor was he pressed by grandeur or self acclaim—lest at first—no—what Kenny Lewis really wanted—what he needed—was the adventure—the chance to use his gadgets among his friends. The chance to use all of these random ass applied skills that he had been mustering—and the chance to do something great with his life. Dude was almost 37 and still living in a frat-like townhouse—maybe we kept him young—maybe he was comfortable—that must be it—frat type environment. Lest on paper he never told me any of this—but I deducted such as much.

And I really wanted that too—some sense of adventure—the Havens were becoming dull—I wanted something to do—something to call my own—something that would somehow someway combine such existential dread into something useful and practical. Working as an Alderman wasn't as all consuming as I initially hoped it would be—and I needed something. I knew that I didn't know how finding a gold coin by Thimble Island would accomplish that—but we marched forward with the plan.

Knowing that Kenny Lewis would never take action about the coin. Knowing that he would keep it in his room and that it would eventually end up in a drawer somewhere—between a portable solar panel and some HDMI converter. No—no, Kenny Lewis would never do it.

So the next morning—as I was outside watching the birds swivel and hunt and as the breeze carried a taste of salt air—I spotted a seagull and pondered at my personal pity party. Another seagull caught my eye and I realized that I was in New Haven, Connecticut—in the cusp of the 21st century—among the roaring 20s. I had a couple of years left before anyone would bat an eye of such antics—thus I deemed it necessary to assemble such a crew and hunt for treasure.

So thus—I lit a cowboy killer—and watched the smoke flutter among the budding spring leaves.

On a piece of yellow pad paper—with a purple crayon I found on the grass near the trash—I wrote:

Get Someone with a boat. Get Someone who knows how to use boat. Someone who knew where to look—based on maps and such. Someone to help us take the raw materials off the island—into the boat—transport it from Branford to Bethany and make some route along 95. Someone to help with security measures. Someone to help with snacks the day of.

I pinned up the first two items as things to worry about later. What I was most interested in was someone who knew how to read maps—and the only person I associated with maps was an elderly librarian woman I befriended while working out of the library—Sandra Miller. Sandra once showed me a collection of New Haven maps. Perhaps she had one of the Thimble Islands.

I figured I needed to figure out how to take off work for a couple of days. Being a freelancer means no one is your boss—many people are your boss. So I googled best way to let people know to back off and I settled upon an automatic email reply—saying that I would be out of office until next Monday. I let it slide until the following because I didn't want to jump into something just yet. But the system worked and I'd be able to pull the trigger when ready.

I drove to the Planet Fitness—didn't want to go off the one off of Whalley as it was too naff and gangster for my taste—I heard that Gonz got mugged outside his apartment and since then had been wary of hanging around big empty parking lots during some choice neighborhoods at night. Fuck what I'm supposed to think—I wasn't having it. So I drove on the coast along 142 and ended up in East Haven—after realizing that Hamden doesn't have a Planet Fitness at all. And I—at 10:30 in my clogs after a month of solid eating horribly—came back to the gym and did 32 bench presses with light weight. I thought about all the ways I've and things I've done except working out—and pitied myself—wondering why I'd get so far gone.

I did two more sets and then texted ideas on my phone. I was having a good old fashion pity party about the whole endeavor and had to reach deep down—after 2 sets—I felt like I could do anything.

Kenny Lewis is the man—and I this would be good for him. Everyone needs adventure—don't they? And this seems to be pretty low hanging fruit—something useful to stress about—something that would get the mind in the positive direction. It'll take heart—determination and careful planning.

A lot of that courage fizzled as I hit the incline bench—think I was doing it wrong and felt the pains in my shoulders a bit.

What was the point of a treasure hunt? For some odd reason I was fully convinced and a gut feeling that we would find massive gold there—and that the alderman thing—

The other problem we faced early on was detection. I didn't know the legalities exactly—so I wrote a note to be sure to consult with my friend Brenn—who was some hot shot law student out of Quinnipiac who had a chip on his shoulder that he wasn't studying at Yale—but lived in East Rock nonetheless.

The first order of business was to assemble a time and place to meet. Least to myself—I needed to feel the reassurance of having something planned and prepared beforehand—I would settle on meeting in the backwoods of Krauser's—but wanted to lavish the troops. So I decided that the rooftop of Elm City Social fit the bill—but when I called to inquire—they informed me that the rooftop won't be open until after Labor Day—around 72 days away I told the bartender—"if that's the right math—then yes"—"Okay," said I—"I'll hold you to it then."

I walked around my room a bit—and found some frozen dumplings in the freezer. And I was finishing them up outside—I imagined what this backyard would be like in the summer—and drifted off into la la land.

I became overwhelmed. Overwhelmed that I had all this work to do. Overwhelmed that I had all of these ideas but no one to share them with. No partner—nothing but the moon. And it was in that weird eye looking moon that just makes one feel like they're up to something evil.

But aye—I recognized this voice—this internal little moth of a rat—and I did 16 pushups to spite it. And immediately after the set—sporadically cleaned my room and did 16 more. And took a vow to the moon that I would do ten sets that day from now on.

Fuck this.

I started googling images on Pinterest of boats and treasure hunts and filled my screen with childhood imagery I long forgot.

I started an email thread—but then worried that no one would check their email—so I started a GroupMe group chat—but then felt that such a move was too European and I wanted to settle on American communication. So I landed on an SMS group chat and praised God that to my surprise—everyone had an iPhone—and I could drag and drop documents from my computer.

We settled upon Elm City Social—but I had to revamp the plans as they were not open until Labor Day.

I watched the wind play with the leaves against the neighbor's fire escape and tried to visualize what this treasure hunt might look like. Considering my list—I considered how much to allot to this effort—and decided to double down on the delusion—setting a budget for $225 dollars would sufficiently aid the crazy—such a low budget—perhaps would spark a heaven of volunteerism—lest creative activity. I lit another heater. It was 9:37pm and I had already checked my email, my telegram, my WhatsApp, my Insta—several times. Click by click the treasure hunt grew smaller—and the idea, delusional. Click by click I grew okay with my cowardice—justifying that little fearful voice was really an angel whispering that this is all but a fairytale—that the treasure hunt is absurd—that time will be wasted and the work will be dissolved into vanity. That the town would find out about my efforts and call me insane.

I cracked my neck and did 16 pushups. I ran to the bathroom—took a hard look and slapped myself so hard that my olive skin turned red. It was time to step it up and quit being a little bitch. I wrote a list of people to call.

A place where the sea is harvested like a crop. It is quiet—and the silence teaches patience.

**Focus:**
- Slow the pace with reflection (the list, the budget, the slap, the moon).
- Hide a clue in the stillness (Sandra Miller, the maps, the purple crayon, Brenn).

# The Fathom Engine

**Chapter 22: Getting the Boat—SS Zulu**

Two days turned into 5 days but moves were made. Somehow, someway I found my hands on a handsome but beat up Boston Whaler with the name SS Zulu painted on the side.

I stood outside Action RPG—Dominic's business he ran with his brothers—which stood for, apparently, Roofing, Paving at Great Value. This was neither roofing nor a paving request—instead I wanted them to look at the engine and determine if the bird was good enough for flight. The brothers agreed to help clean up the boat—glue it where it needed to be glued—and doze it with a fresh coat of extra paint.

I watched the brothers as they danced about in harmony—I stepped back and entered the back of the mind and minded all of the other moving pieces in play. I checked each individual status of 10 second-hand metal detectors and I wondered if I had calculated the fact that some may need new batteries. How long are we scanning the sand?

Dominic wanted to know what was the payout if we found the gold—I told him the truth—10 percent per member of this party. Dominic took a second and did some math—"so where does the remaining 20 go?" "I figured we could put it in a fund to fuel more expeditions—that or we'll just buy some bitcoin and separate that another eight ways." replied I. "Fake gold for real gold? That's wild—wild wild wild—World's gone wild Davey."

Dominic put the bucket down and walked over to a makeshift fridge he had next to the portable bathroom station—he reached in and grabbed four Dr. Thunders. "I don't know about that Davey—I gotta check with my uncles about that." He passed a Thunder to me—I cracked it.

A relic meant to measure depth begins to malfunction. The readings grow impossible.

**Focus:**
- Introduce a mysterious device (the boat, the engine, the metal detectors).
- Suggest the world is changing (bitcoin, Dr. Thunder, the uncles).

# The Broken Causeway

There was much talk about buying versus renting a boat and Kenny Lewis didn't know why there was so much talking about something—where renting was the real answer. I, having a fear of having to share the spoils with the chef, didn't want any future nonsense—if we owned the boat—we have control—we can go and rent—I would argue—yes—but what if there is no treasure—Captain Kidd's treasure on Thimble Island—because you found a gold coin. We found a gold coin—I would interject.

It's hard to lead a group of pirates when the first couple of mates do not show you the respect that you want.

Perhaps in Chapter 22—that is the day before they go for the treasure—it is Josh's birthday and there is a general kumbaya.

A causeway has fallen into the water. The detour is longer and demands more supplies.

**Focus:**
- Force a sacrifice of resources (buy vs rent; control vs cost).
- Reveal who the group trusts (Kenny Lewis, Josh, the debate).

# The Sleeper's Wake

**Chapter 23: That Time We Found the Treasure**

It was a warm Saturday morning—the kind of June day that made you forget that you are writing this in the cold—that there ever was such a thing as winter.

Yada yada yada—I was up and showered—in the shower I privately talked to myself and vaped and vaped—I was nervous—this was the day—how was I doing emotionally? Living in the moment of it—I trained for this moment—but didn't give myself a lot of time to think. I marched.

I went downstairs—Kenny Lewis was cleaning up the plates and in front of me—on a happy birthday plate—

Snacks. Snacks. Snacks. Someone with a map. Research how to find treasure in sand.

It was cold on the day we embarked. A bit of fog went up the Long Island Sound—we all awoke and Bobby McArnold was making breakfast—something he was talking about for a couple of days now.

A figure wakes after a long illness and speaks of the Havens in riddles. Their memory is partial—but urgent.

**Focus:**
- Drop a cryptic warning (the plate, the snacks, the day).
- Spark an argument (breakfast, the crew, the fog).

# The Long Migration

The Art of Boat Building. Detailed efforts in designing and constructing the boat—with community members contributing skills and resources.

Setting Sail. The completion of the boat and the launch ceremony—highlighting the support from local politicians who see the value in the friends' endeavor.

Navigating the Waters. The team embarks on their journey—facing natural and man-made challenges as they approach Thimble Island.

I went home that night and scouted my room and stress packed a bag. I couldn't help packing everything I could get my hands on—cards, cables, a dollar store coloring book left over from a kids party, gum, a ruler, scissors, a battery powered fan, bug spray—and I quit when I held a cup of yogurt to the light—wondering if it was bad—I knew I had my fill. Tomorrow was the day if we were going to see if this Boston Whaler float. That night I streamed Seinfeld on the tele and tried to go to bed. I turned over as the blue light was bothering me and opened up the window a bit. Listening to the distant cars and motorbikes and city sounds—I imagined what it would be like to hear waves.

A moving community crosses the path. Their stories mirror the group's pursuit.

**Focus:**
- Show another way to survive (the boat, the crew, the voyage).
- Offer a choice to join or pass (Thimble Island; the treasure).

# The Covenant Stone

**A Historic Discovery.** The friends uncover the treasure—which includes artifacts of significant cultural and historical value.

I spent a lot of time googling—the history of Thimble Island treasure—and after the first result came up as *In 1699, the pirate Capt. William Kidd had treasure buried on Gardiners Island, the private island located between the Twin Forks. It's a true story, but the fact is that Kidd never did it. Instead, he got the owner of the island, Jonathan Gardiner, to bury it somewhere secret on the island.*—I was hooked.

Knowing that Kenny Lewis wouldn't pull the trigger—knowing that momentum would soon fade—and knowing that Bobby McArnold would eventually talk himself out of it—I decided that here—right now—this right present moment—this in the day the Lord has made—I shall assemble a team and see for certain—if there were any additional treasure.

The treasure hunting business is not for the faint of heart. Nor the feint.

That night I stared at the ceiling—and began to write names on blank index cards.

A stone marks a promise made generations ago. It is both map and memorial.

**Focus:**
- Ground the myth in history (Kidd, Gardiner, the treasure).
- Reveal the original oath (the team, the index cards, the covenant).

**Negotiations with Uncle Sam.** The authorities express interest in the treasure—leading to negotiations about its fate.

**The Exception.** Thanks to the political goodwill they've garnered—an agreement is reached allowing the friends to keep the treasure under certain conditions.

Can't. Feels illegal. If we turn it in—they're gonna ask how they got it. We're have burying it again—and leave some clues. Passing ordinance—carve something. As the alder—needs to preserve it in the New Haven museum—flesh out.

Alderman thinks he is president. Answers email.

Ending—someone finds the gold.

A harbor is tucked between cliffs. It feels like arrival—but it is not the destination.

**Focus:**
- Provide temporary peace (the deal, the exception).
- Introduce a new threat (illegal, the museum, the ordinance, someone finds the gold).

# The Hawser's End

**The Treasure's True Value.** The friends decide to use the treasure to benefit the community—planning a museum and educational programs.

**Chapter 35: Branford Library—Money**

I took a long drive. I ended up at Branford Library—Blackstone to be precise—lest I think that's what it was called. I was caught up worrying about money again—the 5k I ended up making from spoils of the treasure hunt last summer—rested pretty—in a 4.5% APR money market account that was tempting me terribly.

I, having no foreseeable income other than the Alderman stipend of $3,600 promised to me come May—was fighting desperation. The last website I built was for an author—which whom I will not name—no no no—but it was okay—the gentleman paid me 3 installments of $4000 dollars—which after taxes—came out to be three installments of $950 dollars—which honestly—sucked—being that my rent was also $950. I didn't want to be in the red—but if something didn't change soon—my little budgeting app would be very, very sad.

I calculated my fixed costs and determined that the money for food and what not would have to come elsewhere—thus I took 2k from my life savings of 9k—and divided things so I had 2k in a checking account—and 7k in another money market account—getting 4.5% a year. The 5k from the treasure was separate—untouchable—sacred. I would rather wither on the streets than to use it for something temporary like rent or a grumbling belly—no no no—that treasure had to be used for a good purpose.

A rope snaps at the worst moment. The group learns that even small failures can change fate.

**Focus:**
- Create a crisis of trust (money, the stipend, the treasure's true value).
- Identify a fragile relationship (Patrick and stability; the museum vs survival).

**Chapter 36: Bikes Stolen**

Fuck New Haven. I couldn't take it—and neither could Kenny Lewis—we both were steaming down in the kitchen—Lewis over justice—me over just the feeling of obstruction—and sick and tired of all of the gangster nonsense—I wanted the gangster to change their ways—and just be cool and relax—and stop stealing—and just change their vibes—I didn't like the idea of punishment—but I did want folks to feel sorry for what they have done.

Kenny Lewis believed strongly in the justice system and wanted them to face a jury and go through the process—and I was like dude—those bikes were like 400 total—probably more—probably less—who cares. He didn't like that—for he cared—for reasons, still I can't make out. Regardless he made it clear that he'd be investing in Ring cameras—Josh said he'd put 20 towards that—and I agreed to as well—but I knew that Kenny Lewis knew that I knew the price would be closer to 500.

"Dear Bike Thief, Attached to this letter are some sunflower seeds—go right now—we hope that you plant them in a garden of your choosing—and have fun with it baby—stop being so wack—plant a plant and stop being so gangster—you aren't impressing me—but you could—What WOULD impress me—is if you go and plant a plant—a sunflower—and walk by it everyday—and write a poem—and stop the bullshit—we get it—life sucks—but common—we dare you to plant that plant and challenge you to be cute about it."

Kenny Lewis shrugged his shoulders—"I guess you could write that." Josh was more reassuring than us all—and we took a nice pause that night and watched The Office on Peacock. In the end—I didn't trash the letter—but hung it on our fridge. Kenny Lewis was looking out the window, scouring the streets. I gave him a hug and he flinched a bit—then froze—then let it happen. I haven't hugged a man like that for a while—and to be honest—I loved it—it felt good to hug that frozen man.

Those who tend the lanterns tell the true history. Their testimony is not what anyone expected.

**Focus:**
- Subvert the legend (the letter, the sunflower, the hug).
- Move toward reconciliation (Kenny Lewis, Josh, the fridge).

**Chapter 37: The Coffee Peddler—Laundry Cafe Idea**

That night I went to bed and juiced up on Google Maps—hoping to scout the Havens and make a bit of a fuss—but I was tired so I decided to go to the Coffee Peddler in the morning. The Coffee Peddler—would be a good place to start—mainly because it was so close to home and I was feeling lazy.

My initial plan was to start with a series of small wins and progressively increase the small wins into small milestones that I would have on some small chart that I'd hang with a magnet on a mini fridge. My morning, at hand, was simple—go into every coffee shop and examine, take notes and steal. I would trek into every single fucking coffee shop in New Haven—and steal—steal ideas—and emulate.

The plan was to plan a trip to each shop—and take notes of all of the things—all things. Unique things—things I dislike—things like a POS system—a refrigerator—ceiling fan—the pretty dangling—Edison bulbs. Things like that I'd write in writing—and later in Excel—and then—when I collect enough data—I'd cross compare and have ChatGPT find me free alternatives to acquire each and every device needed to operate a functional coffee shop.

Business of starting hipster doodle things at diners—but really didn't like the back and forth—the work itself was easy but the communication I couldn't do—I had more things to do—this was supposed to be a system of economic income.

Prototype a laundry machine cafe—for the idea could be viral only if we had a prototype in the backyard. Get a bunch of old laundry machines together—I could have Dominic and the boys pick it up—and then put flyers around town for a potluck cafe laundromat prototype and investor pancake brunch—all in the backyard. Yes. The backyard laundromat cafe.

Currents pull the group off course. The sea is not an enemy—but it refuses to be mastered.

**Focus:**
- Test endurance (the coffee shop recon, the prototype).
- Make space for confession (the back and forth he couldn't do; the dream).

# The Second Haven

**Chapter 38: Three Weeks—Gather, Sultan, Flyers, Door to Door**

Three weeks came and went and not much went on—besides everything.

I settled on a design for the popup cafe laundromat but I second guessed myself. I asked around. I went to Gather and talked to Sultan about the idea—he loved it and encouraged me—I went home that night and talked to Kenny Lewis—he discouraged me. Back and forth back and forth pros and cons list—realizing that I was confronting a certain fear I had by making the decision. I spoke to my mom on the phone that night and found out that my grandmother fell ill and had to be rushed to the ER—my parents—presently having covid—couldn't go and visit her—so that was it—she was stressed on the phone.

I decided to take some action—and gave a hard look at the backyard. I wrote a list of 20 or so folks who I knew would come—but then what—it would turn into a party. So—not wanting it to turn into a party—but a functional business—I decided that we needed to be out and about. I thought about the New Haven Green—and Google mapped it a bit. I gave the school outside of Westville a call and they agreed to it. But I knew that we would have to spread the idea—so I contacted the local 8 news—and they sent out a reporter to follow—and then I hung posters all around town.

I printed 1000 off of Moo.com for around 200 bucks—that of which I used an Apple credit card because I still had 18 months at 0 APR. I printed a map—and I made pins where each and every—I used Google Earth—to scour each and every little popup—and then on a Google Map—I printed—I circled roughly where each one was—I counted 15. Okay—so for the other 9985 flyers—Kenny Lewis suggested that we put them door to door. I called Dominic and the rest of the Gypsy brigade—I had Dave on skates—all handing out to college kids. We would flood the streets—once a week and gather feedback—see if anyone used the QR code.

A place believed lost still stands. The arrival is bittersweet and filled with ghosts.

**Focus:**
- Deliver a major reveal (the popup, the flyers, East Haven / second haven).
- Show the cost of survival (grandmother, mom, Kenny Lewis con, the 200 bucks).

# The Trial of Tides

**Chapter 39: On the Day We Opened the Popup—City Climb, Mr Katz**

It was decided that we would not use a cafe at all—even though it would be easier—because then we would only have to worry about the laundry—I didn't want a place. So we decided to use an abandoned place in City Climb—where there were punk rockers found their dwelling upstairs upstairs. There was a vacant space next to the locker room—that used to be some hip hop DJ station—not sure—but everything was covered with maroon when we walked in. I found that I could rent it for 800 dollars a month. It really was a big space—but disgusting.

I inquired if I could have a month to month lease—at least at first—and then after 3 months—be able to sign something—with the promise, to sweeten the pot—that at the 3 month mark—we would pay 1.1k a month—if we decided to stay there. The owner was named Mr Katz—and I never met him—just his secretary—Mr Katz—from what I heard from the great vine—was a true entrepreneur and was one of those men who were involved with Mandy Management—Pike Release—essentially—the modern day equivalent of a slum lord. Looking at his office—I realized that he would lead from the top. No no no—I didn't give a flying kite about that—lest at the moment—City Climb had name recognition and was ripe for marketing.

We put a bunch of signs all over City Climb—and it was grand. We gave ourselves 3 weeks. The first thing we did was clean out the place—I paid Dominic and Sam 50 dollars each to get all the random stuff and take it to the dump—and then Kenny Lewis, Josh and I cleaned the floors and wiped the walls. The next thing I did was paint—I figured some paint could hide a bunch of damage. What was most important was getting the lighting temperature down—so that is what I focused on. When a user were to first walk in—we would convert their dollars into coins—barcade style. Coins worked for several reasons. We would have a minimum entry per guest—20 dollars. 20 dollars of 20 LaundraCoins—could do all types of things.

What was it about the laundry machines—asked Kenny Lewis—that got me so excited. He then pointed out all the ways in which the project would fail.

A final challenge must be faced before the inner gates open. The tide sets a hard limit.

**Focus:**
- Force a decisive action (City Climb, the lease, the coin system).
- Bring the group to unity (Dominic, Sam, Kenny Lewis, Josh).

# The Open Door

**Chapter 39–40: On the Day We Opened—Everything Worked Out Perfect**

On the day we opened it was cloudy—right before February. For a while it seemed like the weather was wild. Some moments in January provided a winter chill—others—well—others did not. And it was tough for a while. My allergies didn't know how to keep up—but as I blew my nose—I didn't have time to worry about that.

The night before I Pinterest-ed different outfits for opening—I wanted to convey a message that I was of the common man—while still sleek enough for investors to take me seriously.

Everything worked out perfect. Early in the morning there was a line—line out the door. Mostly that were loyal members from the party—which whom I promised free access and breakfast and t-shirts—but they didn't need that. These were my friends. So I then wrote a follow up letter—asking if we could instead give those out to the random strangers—and then in the second batch of supplies.

I enjoyed the fact that this was only once a month—we made 2500 dollars that day. Perhaps we do 2x a month. I didn't want to risk it—and grow depressed—like someone working a deli or a diner—having it open for one weekend a month—the frequency people do laundry in the Haven—freed my mind for other endeavors—and to slowly have this stream of income.

The gate opens. It is not a wall but an invitation that asks who they will become.

**Focus:**
- Resolve the external journey (the popup opens; 2500 dollars).
- Set up inner transformation (once a month; the stream; the risk).

# Home Without Walls

**Chapter 50–51: The Beginning of the End—Quit Vapes—Boston**

It was a while since I picked up this notebook and started writing again. And a lot of—

Today I decided to quit the vapes all together. I drove to Planet Fitness then to Walmart—then to pick up my girlfriend and then to drop her off at my apartment as she had to be at a counseling session and I was losing my mind on account of lack of nicotine. Felt a bit like a crack addict among crack heads at the Walmart—I learned that my tell tale sign was that I didn't have a shopping cart. No no—no shopping cart for me. But since living in East Haven I've really come to love the diversity of the coast here in CT—it's amazing what a little salt air and the way the sun hits the water—turning it into melodic waves.

Oh to be nicotine free—my last puff of the vape was this morning at 10am—and then having properly muscled through the first 10 min—checking the clock—silently chalking an invisible chalk—I wondered how anyone could live as to be such a slave to time—thus I gave up around noon. I caved after a couple of days of not smoking. Actually it was a matter of hours. I decided to switch it up and instead of going no nicotine—I decided not to ingest my nicotine via inhaling—instead I bought a snus at the gas station. It felt like hot ice on top of my gums.

Josh and I decided to move in together a couple of months back and so far it's been so good. Though I do miss the house on East Rock. I saw Kenny Lewis once outside of Atticus Market. I decided that it would be better if I found him when I was terribly withdrawing from nicotine—I kept going and moving forward.

**Epilogue: My present plan is to marry my girlfriend—and give this whole town a kiss goodbye.** We were talking about venturing up to Boston—to see if we could make a little splash—wondering if Boston would have an alderman—or any islands to sail to—or would be privy to running a little laundromat cafe. Kenny Lewis and I used to talk about the bar barge—the bar on the barge for ships and weekend champion sailors to.

What does last forever? Certainly not friendship groups among the Havens. I first came to these shores two years back this coming September. And this September it was my last time. I wrote these entries sporadically and out of order—and let my mind fill in the gaps of time when focused—had to do it that way—hopefully the chronicles and time are all set in place.

What was life before the Havens.

**Epilogue—3 years later.**

The Havens are not a fortress but a way of living. The story ends with a new definition of refuge.

**Focus:**
- Close with a thematic statement (home without walls; Boston; marry; kiss goodbye).
- Leave room for continuation (3 years later; what was life before the Havens).
