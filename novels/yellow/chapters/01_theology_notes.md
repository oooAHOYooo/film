Theology notes live here.

Use this space for structured chapters, essays, or a sequence of reflections.

Start with the question: what is theology for? Define the purpose as love of God and love of neighbor.

Focus:
- Frame the projectâ€™s scope.
- Name the posture of humility.


Question:
Do we spend too much time romanticising the actual life of Christ? Of his human nature? Rather than search for his kingship before his time on earth.

I asked this casually at a superbowl party and got lost in the answer between Josh Kebabian and Preston Graham. But I thought a bout it - and questioned why I was questioning this. Was the story getting dull for me? Have I heard it too much that my brain, aggorantly thinks that I know everything there is to know about the subject, and then boom doing it again - looking for something other than Christ to fulfill my gaping hole. A habit which I am still prone to do. 

And then boom - what becomes - what becomes of worship - does that mean that I now praise Jesus on the throne? Is he still in his white robe? Have the imagery and icons of the Cathy's cemented so deep into my mind? But maybe that's a good thing? Santa Claus is easy to conjure up and thus I talk about Santa Claus. Those images help one bring into a target - like the aim in binoculars - a distant little red dot on the white golf ball among the sand.
