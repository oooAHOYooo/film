EXT. OUTPOST — DAY

HENRI

Do you know how to fly?

PROFESSOR

I don't—but we assumed that because you are from a different world, that perhaps you would have abilities that we Machulu people wouldn't.

HENRI

You just gave me a soapbox sermon about how flying only resides if my will allows. If that's all it took—why don't you fly?

PROFESSOR

Aye that's a good question. Well, truth revealed—we are here to learn. From you Henri. For we don't know how, but hope you do—and will teach us.
