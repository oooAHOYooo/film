EXT. WOOD — HIDING

As Henri studies the mechanics—something to take his mind off the present danger and the tension in the air—the dust spins in so many different directions.

Spirals at first. But then it starts to turn more angular, geometrical almost. Like tiny 2D triangles slowly turning 3D, as if lifting off the page. Though there is no page—this is the dirt.

Either the dirt itself is made out of a material Henri cannot fathom—or the fathom itself is too much of a material known to fathom. In other words, this is much too wild. Much too physics bending.
