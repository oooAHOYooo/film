# Treatment - Latest Draft

Dallas moves to town. Dallas hears a noise – out of curiosity he opens up a box of his old equipment. Dallas through it all hears a hum. Dallas records readings but the battery dies. Dallas walks into town for batteries – and on the way – he meets his neighbor Dominic – who follows him on his journey. On the way, Dominic convinces Dallas to come to a fellowship lunch at his church. They go.

As they venture – Dominic discovers that there is a ticket on his car and gets upset. Dominic begins a long rant about the towns raccoon problems and wonder where all of his money is going. While Dallas and Dominic walk home they walk towards the marsh – and the wind – and the New England coast – as they walk coyotes howl in the far distance – “What are you here for” asks Dominic – “Work” answers Dallas “At Yale?” “Quinnipiac” – Dallas explains that he is going to work next semester – so he has a couple of months of to get settled. Nice “So are you here alone?” – “Yep” -

The two get lost around branford for a bit – wandering through different marsh lands and tall grass. Dominic listens – as he knows a lo about the different birds and wants to get this app on his phone that could tell the species. As they continue – they witness a bunch of news vans huddled outside of the nearby town center. News specialist Pat Clendenen – bangs on about the Nor’easter – and prepares folks for wild set of upcoming weather – hopefully that doesn’t come past this weekend’s festival.

As they approach the house – Dominic becomes more and more upset – as he notices that his trash cans are duped over the side of the house Dominic invitees Dallas over to help him clean a mess that the kids made while they were over – mainly just furniture needs to be rearranged – and while they are exiting Dominic’s house moving – Dallas notices a painting of someone who is no longer around – Dallas looks for a moment and gets a moment of looks and meets eyes with Mr. Mike – who is in the corner yelling. Dominic walks over – “Yeah yeah – that was my wife – and my child” Dominic asks if Dallas had someone special in his life “Yes, but not anymore” – they look at each other – yeah – it has been tough – how you holding up? Alright – how are you holding up? Alright – Mr Mike begins to look out the window and is getting flustered at the weather. “She’s here – he yells”

All of a sudden Dominics sister Janice visits with her kids, teasing Dallas into Dog sitting her dog Howie – Dallas agrees. Janice walks over to discover that Dominic is cooking the brusque sprouts incorrectly – and the gravy is a mess. An argument erupts. Janice’s daughter Makayla – a young 20 something – walks right to Dallas and begins to pepper him with questions about the equipment he was carrying the other day – she saw at church. Asher, her little brother – 15 looks at the distant bushes and greets Mr. Mike haphazardly. Dominic ushers everyone to get into the car – they are going to be late – the crew in a whirlwind of activity, leave Dallas alone with the dog Howie.

As he walks home with Howie, The Long Island Sound roars against the Branford rocks, and Dallas notices that his portable reader spikes violently near the distant field near the tall grass. Distant dogs bark in the distance – followed by even further away coyotes – and the storm alerts pop up. The hum begins – and it grows denser and deeper and eventually everywhere – Dallas checks his surroundings and begins to stare at it in a daze – Howie is afraid which prompts Dallas to move on.

That night, Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. Dominic shows up with Asher to collect Howie and asks if everything is okay – “It is fine” replies Dallas. Later that night, Dallas looks out the window again at the marsh – his equipment ready but they read silent – he touches a photo of his late wife – and then the hum begins. As Dallas looks tall shadows grow in the distance and move against the wind. The distant sounds becomes more distinct – but distant.

Dawn. The storm approaches. Janice drops off her dog Howie before rushing to work at the museum, where she’s apparently helping secure artwork before the hurricane hits. She thanks Dallas tremendously who, in return, doesn’t say much – but begins to have an a kinship with this little dog. Outside, Makayla and Asher run off in the distance to look at something in the far distance of Dallas’ house – she yells at them to get to the car – as she explains to Dallas that the schools were canceled due to the weather – but she thinks it is all the bull. Dominic emerges from the mini-van to help the kids in – and runs over – pets Howie – and asks Dallas if he needs anything from Costco – and if he doesn’t mind printing songs for life group tonight. D

Dallas and Howie step out into a long trail around their costal neighborhood – they stop by the creek behind their house – and suddenly from a distance – the roar and hum begin. Howie’s ears perk up and runs up to Dallas as if he wants to be held. Dallas holds Howie. And as he does – a light flickers in the far distance. Dallas is drawn to the light – and in a daze begins to walk towards it – much to Howie’s objections. Dallas’ equipment begins to beep – and Dallas – noticing this – ties Howie to a nearby tree on the edge of the salt marsh – and begins to enter the tall grass.

As he does – and almost in a daze – Dallas walks to a shrunken tree hollow – where it almost looks like dozens of eyes surround him through the tall yellow reeds – in that hollow a movement of leaves – and in that movement – a cry of what sounds like an animal. The cry continues – putting Dallas into a daze as he begins to approach it.

As Dallas approaches the hollow – he sees a shrunken leaf pile – as he moves closer he discovers that something is dying inside of it. It is a tiny creature. The creature breathes heavily – and emits the cry – but it doesn’t come out of his mouth – but instead the noise is caused by certain flapping holes of its back – as if it is a bit of an instrument – it lets out a cry. The creature is fragile, birdlike, covered in downy fur, with long rabbit-like ears and a diminishing flickering glow beneath its neck. Dallas – amazed by the creature – stares for a good while at its complexity and beauty – when suddenly – he realizes that its pulse is slowing. In the distance suddenly – Dallas senses an urgent fear – as if something massive is following him in the distance – rocketing closer and closer through the blades like an arrow – Dallas quickly grabs the creature in his coat – and rushes outside. Howie does not like this – and begins to freak out. Dallas, the creature, and Howie – make the long journey back to the house.

When Dallas finally arrives – he brings it into his kitchen – and as he does – his outdoor porch like instruments begin to pulse. Dallas soon discovers that the instruments pulse in sync with the creatures heartbeat – and as the creature begins to fade – Dallas tries to turn the dial into a normal frequency and that seems to put the creature to sleep. Howie – disturbed in the corner – waits by the door for his owner and Dallas – tries to hide the creature – but when it cries – the world outside echoes – and then the ugly hum responds with a source far away. The hum floods the town. Windows rattle.

Janice and Dominic return – carrying loads of haphazard boxes from Costco – Dominic thanks Dallas again for letting the life group meet tonight at their house and as they explain – Dallas tries to avoid them going to the creature – Mr Mike walks in and begins to freak out – his points to the creature – and says what is that – what is that? Makayla walking behind him spots the creature and, without fear, knees to attend to its wound. Its glow begins to brighten with her touch. Soon Asher joins the huddle – and Dominic yells for everyone to be calm. And then he himself notices the creature and pushes everyone out of the way.

As they are on the kitchen table now with the instruments that Dallas is trying to heal the creature back to life – Dominic begins to list off all of the reasons – Janice begins to say that they should put it back where they found it – they can’t have it in the house – and Mr Mike begins to yell that they need to leave now – that they are coming for the creature – and that it is not safe here.

As the crew scramble with the creature downstairs - the door bell upstairs chimes – the first family to join the life group – a young couple with a newborn JP – enter the scene and begin to introduce themselves to Dallas who acts a bit off – Dominic paces in the kitchen – and Mr Mike mutters to himself in the chair – looks at the weather outside getting worse – and utters that this is all a farce – they should be out their and return the creature. But the couple knows to politely ignore Mr Mike –

More and more families begin to arrive – filling up Dallas’ little kitchen and living room.

Dallas excuses himself to the basement to go get some drinks – but really he goes and checks the status of the dying creature. Across the room he looks and does not see much in terms of progress. For a moment the creature does not look like it is doing much – but breathing slightly – Dallas struggles to look for a little shoe box – he takes one with his wife’s pictures and what not – and puts them aside and puts the creature inside – in it – it is barely breathing – its little wings curl tightly. Makayla and Asher bring Dallas a tiny bottle of water – and Dallas finds a way to poke a hole to make it drinkable – Makayla and Asher watch from the staircase.

Dallas eventually goes upstairs to life group – and the leader Josh – one of the young couples – begins to give an opening ice breaker – while Dallas, Dominic and his two kids kind of sit silent. Tyler hands out music for everyone to sing and they do.

During the time of reflection – the hum begins to start up again – leaving everyone unsettled and is like what the heck was that? There is some more talk of the weird weather patterns that have been plaguing their little Branford community and that is what they settle with. In time – people leave and hug goodbye – as Dominic waves them goodbye – he waits for the last person to leave before he rushes downstairs with the kids to see what the deal is with the creature that Dallas’ has been nursing.

The creature is in some makeshift box and Dallas has a heat lamp to it – and is curious that the creature, like a little bird responds to his machines. They don’t seem to be. It is sleeping it seems. In the morning the crew decided that it will go and drop it off where they found it. As they discuss this Dallas stares blankly half listening. The hum is back. Dominic and Janice and the kids leave with Mr Mike – who tells them that it is a mistake to not return the creature tonight.

That night Dallas stares awake and looks out the tall window – in the distance – through his backyard- he notices bright eyes watching his house from the border of the tall salt marsh. As he looks deeper into their gaze they fade away. Dallas goes downstairs to look for the creature but it is gone. Nervous – he begins to look out the window again – the eyes are gone – and the night is still.

Makayla arrives to drop off Howie in the morning – and can’t seem to find Dallas – he is staring at the abyss outside with a tiny detector. Makayla watches Dallas for a moment and then begins to copy him. The two begin to make a fence around the house. Dallas looks over and acknowledges her presence. Makayla asks what happens and Dallas the creature is gone. But it was injured. Together they hear another cry that sounds like a big distant – the creatures – and then that familiar hum. Makayla turns to Dallas – we have to go get it back – they want to kill it. Dallas and Makayla begin to walk the trail with Howie – and see the same glow. They rush over – and by and by – as they inch closer to the salt marsh - they find a group of creatures all attending to the injured creature from before.

At first, the creatures scatter about – the younger ones – two or three of them - but the older ones wave their hands a bit – and Makayla and Dallas are frozen. They can move their heads and but not their bodies nor hands. In the quiet moments later, more lights appear. Dozens of glows rise like lanterns in the distant mist. All around them the predators emerge – with their glowing red eyes and for every inch they creep – their shadow goes up the tall grass. The paralysis of Dallas and Makayla – seems to be caused by an elder of the creatures and their full might – but are no match – they begin to focus on the predators actions.

The predators eyes blink a bit and causes great fear amount the creatures to huddle around. Dallas and Makayla run away – but not before Dallas has one more interaction with the tiny little creature – and he begins to dial his instrument – which causes the creatures to retract.

The storm comes and Makayla runs towards her mom – Mr. Mike, Asher and Dominic are outside – Dallas looks stunned. And he begins to get poles and hang them around. Dominic not saying anything begins to help him. Dallas continues to examine the perimeter around the house. Outside again they have the news van playing on the radio – of Mr Clendenen himself – welcoming Branford into a beautiful southern New England morning.

Dallas Jams the last pole into the mud – and the crew stare at the tall grass. I say leave the creature. Dallas and Makayla dig. Soon they hear the sudden crawl of fire engines – and sea birds – and eventually the hum. Dallas begins to walk back to the house – and the crew behind him. They await on the porch and wait for the perimeter. This is crazy says Dominic – what are we doing here.

The crew makes a decision here if should go back – they do go back – and they see the creature again – and they try to grab it – but the eyes follow them. Dominic at first is hesitant – and is asking Dallas for answers about the field. Dominic decliens and say that we should just focus on boarding up the house for the storm – but as he speaks – Makayla, in a heap, runs out the door and by herself into the tall grass. Dominic cant catch her – and begins to follow after her.

Dominic asks Dallas if he thinks what the fence is about – and how it works – it sends a frequency he doesn’t think they are right. How do you know this Dallas? I don’t he replies. Dominic begins to pace and call out for Makayla. Dominic asks Dallas if he could watch Mr Mike – and him and Asher head into the tall grass to look for Makayla.

Dallas waits with Howie. The storm approaches and the two get antsy.

Dallas jams the last pole into the mud – but the light on the tip flickers and dies. The hum from the marsh isn’t a hum anymore – it is a scream. The red eyes in the tall grass multiply – dozens of them – blinking in and out of existence. The invisible fence isn’t holding. The perimeter is breached.

Dallas and Dominic – hover over the entrance. They slam the door against a wind that feels like it has hands – the locks click – but the whole house shudders. Boom boom boom – the walls rattle like a drum.

Makayla

In the kitchen, the group is huddled – Mr Mike still peers out the window – yelling “they are coming they are coming” – The creature in the shoebox is dim – barely a spark – its breathing shallow. Mr. Mike stands up – his eyes wild – pointing at the darkness pressing against the window pane. “It’s the silence!” he yells – spittle flying – “They want the silence! They hate the joy! They hate the noise of the living!”

Dallas looks at his equipment on the table – the needle is flatlining. Makayla is by the box – ignoring the terror outside. She looks at the creature – then at the sheet music scattered on the table. Thump. Thump. Thump. The creature’s dying light pulses.

“It’s the beat,” she whispers. She looks at Dallas – eyes wide – “It matches. It’s the song from earlier. Mr Mike is singing ” She starts to hum – shaky at first – a melody against the roar of the wind. The creature’s ear twitches. Its glow stabilizes.

Dallas understands. He looks at the terrified faces.

“What?” asks Dominic – bewildered.

“Sing the song! Loud!” Dallas yells over the thunder. “Do it now!”

Dominic looks at Janice – who looks at the young couple. Makayla sings louder – her voice finding the strength. Asher joins in – off-key but loud. The young couple joins. They start – awkwardly – a ragged chorus of voices rising in the kitchen.

As the volume rises – the creature in the shoebox sits up. It opens its mouth – and a pure, bell-like tone joins them – weaving through their voices.

The sound hits the walls and vibrates the floorboards. The glow from the shoebox erupts – turning the kitchen blinding white. Outside – the other creatures in the yard join in – a thousand tiny whistles harmonizing. The red eyes in the yard widen in terror. The shadows try to push forward – clawing at the siding – but the wall of sound hits them like a physical blow. The ugly hum dissolves. The shadows shatter – dissolving into the rain like ink in water. The storm clouds above the house rip open – pushed back by the sheer pressure of the song.

The singing stops – leaving a ringing silence that feels safe.

Dallas walks to the porch – his equipment left behind on the table. The rain has stopped. The mist clears. The creatures – healed by the sound – begin to float. They rise out of the tall grass – drifting upward – glowing orbs against the retreating storm clouds – like paper lanterns released at a festival. They drift higher and higher – spiraling over the Long Island Sound – until they merge with the stars clearing in the night sky. Gone.

Dallas watches until the last light fades. He looks down at the shoebox. It is empty – save for the photo of his wife. He touches her face in the picture. The hum is gone. The detector is silent.

“Bye,” he whispers.

He turns around. Inside – the fear is gone. Dominic is laughing at something Asher said. Baby JP is asleep. And the smell – garlic and butter fills the room. Janice is at the stove – tossing the pan with a smile. “Finally,” she says – “I think the Brussels sprouts are actually crisping up.”

“Need any help?” Dallas asks.

“Yeah,” Dominic says, handing him a plate. “Grab a seat.”

Dallas walks in – and shuts the door.
