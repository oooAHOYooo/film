### The Ghost (Max)

The Ghost was once a successful businessman who had a bright future ahead of him. He was passionate about his work and dedicated to making a difference in the world. However, he discovered that the company he was working for was engaged in unethical practices that were causing harm to people and the environment.

He tried to raise his concerns with his superiors, but they ignored him and even threatened to fire him if he continued to speak out. Frustrated and disillusioned, The Ghost decided to blow the whistle on the company's illegal activities. However, his efforts were in vain, and the company managed to cover up its misdeeds and discredit him in the process.

As a result of his whistleblowing, The Ghost lost his job, his reputation, and his family. He became bitter and resentful towards the system and those who had wronged him. He started to believe that the only way to fight back was from the shadows — and so The Ghost was born. He is Rob's trusted partner; elusive and mysterious, but his loyalty is unwavering.
