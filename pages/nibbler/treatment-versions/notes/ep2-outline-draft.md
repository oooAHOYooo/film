## Possible Outline 2

### 0A INT. DIMLY LIT POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A hazy room filled with flickering fluorescent lights and weary detectives. ROB MEGLIO, a seasoned detective with haunted eyes and a troubled past, sits at a cluttered desk, poring over case files.

**VOICEOVER ROB**  
_They call me "The Nibbler," the one who takes a bite out of crime. The people of this city have seen me in action, witnessed my dedication to keeping their streets safe. They've come to trust in my abilities, my unwavering determination —_

**VOICEOVER (ROB MEGLIO)**  
_Assigned to investigate a series of high-profile robberies, I became consumed with catching The Weevil. An elusive figure who operated outside the shadows of the law, leaving behind a trail of mystery and chaos. But little did I know, the truth would be far more twisted than I could ever imagine._

### 0A INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE

Rob, dressed in a worn-out trench coat, follows the clues, navigating the shadows of the dimly lit warehouse. He finds a series of **post-it notes on the ground** — and it eventually leads him to a man sitting behind a desk. Upon further revision — Rob notices that it is indeed the Weevil himself! Rob dashes for his pistol and handcuffs.

**ROB**  
_Freeze!_

BANG!

A puff of smoke and he is out of frame — leaving Rob standing in a stupor.

# TITLE CREDITS MONTAGE = THE NIBBLER

## Downtown Bar

Rob comes bursting through the doors. With his hand bleeding — the maid looks around — what happened — Rob is huffing and puffing. Or the ghost comes running in.

Rob looks and is unimpressed — and reminds him that we have work to do rookie.

### 1B INT. BAR

**VOICEOVER ROB (whispering)**  
_The mayor's scandal with Japan... it's more than just a stain on his reputation. I believe The Weevil is orchestrating this, pulling strings behind the scenes to manipulate the city's fate._

**VOICEOVER ROB (whispering)**  
_The Weevil... a master manipulator. He thrives in chaos and feeds off the vulnerability of others. This scandal is just another pawn in his twisted game._

- GHOST ENTERS 1B

Rob sits at the bar, nursing a glass of whiskey. The dimly lit room is filled with the murmur of conversation and the clinking of glasses. As he takes a sip, his eyes scan the room, catching glimpses of admiration and respect from the patrons. The women at the bar give him coy smiles, while the men nod in acknowledgment.

**VOICEOVER ROB**  
_I couldn't tell anyone, for they wouldn't believe me. I had witnessed the truth, seen the Weevil in action. But without hard evidence, it was just my word against his._

Rob begins to read the tattered paper on the bar. The headline reads: "Mayor's Japan Scandal Resurfaces: A Dark Secret Threatens New Haven's Future." Rob's eyes scan the article, his expression a mixture of concern and intrigue. The diner buzzes with activity around him, but he remains engrossed in the unfolding events.

As if on cue, the Ghost enters the bar, his presence commanding attention. He nods at Rob, acknowledging their shared mission.

**VOICEOVER ROB**  
Max, my trusted partner, known as the Ghost, has stood by my side through thick and thin. Together, we've faced countless dangers, fought against the forces of evil. He may be elusive and mysterious, but his loyalty is unwavering.

The patrons of the bar, both men and women, watch with admiration as the Ghost joins Rob at the bar. They share stories and exchange nods of camaraderie, a bond formed through their shared commitment to justice.

**ROB**  
_(toasting)_ "To New Haven, a city on the verge of change. Together, we will emerge from the shadows, stronger and united."

The bar erupts in cheers and applause, the support of the community echoing through the air. The Nibbler and the Ghost, beloved by both ladies and men, have become symbols of hope in a city grappling with darkness.

### 2A INT. DINER

Rob leans forward, his eyes filled with intensity as he addresses the Ghost. The busy ambiance of the diner fades into the background, as his voice takes on a more serious tone.

**ROB**  
_I was tailing a lead, deep into the heart of the city. It was late, and the shadows danced in the dimly lit alleyways. That's when I saw him, the Weevil, lurking in the darkness._

**GHOST**  
_(with curiosity)_ What did you see, Rob? Tell me everything.

Rob takes a deep breath, his gaze fixed on the tabletop as he recalls the encounter vividly.
