VOICEOVER (V.O.)

New Haven... a city draped in shadows, where the scales of justice tremble upon a fragile precipice. Within me resides an unyielding pursuit of truth, burdened by the weight of an elusive past.

I am Rob Meglio, once celebrated as The Nibbler, a hero whose name resonated through the hearts of the public. The mayor himself praised my deeds, but now I question where I truly stand in the delicate balance of right and wrong.

The cries for justice echo relentlessly, piercing the depths of my being. Each unanswered plea adds to the burden I carry, an obligation to those who cannot speak for themselves.

I wander through these labyrinthine streets, haunted by doubts that claw at my soul. The relentless pursuit of truth has taken its toll, transforming the celebrated hero into a tormented figure, lost in the enigmatic embrace of darkness.

In the depths of my memories lie moments of glory, when I basked in the adoration of the masses. But now, I question whether that applause was mere facade, veiling the truth that lurks in the shadows.

Amidst the clamor of my restless thoughts, I grapple with the delicate balance of my own existence. The distinction between justice and obsession blurs, leaving me uncertain of my place in this relentless battle.

As I carry the weight of the pendant against my chest, a reminder of a forgotten promise, I navigate the treacherous path between morality and obsession. The cries for justice fuel my resolve, but I am left wondering if the pursuit itself has become my nemesis.

In this labyrinthine journey, the boundaries of right and wrong become distorted, leaving me to question my own sanity. The once unwavering beacon of truth now flickers, casting doubts upon my purpose and my worth.

Yet, I press on, determined to unravel the enigmas that lie shrouded in the darkness. For amidst the uncertainty, one thing remains clear — the echoes of justice will not be silenced, and I must heed their call.

FADE OUT.
