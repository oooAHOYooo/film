# Opening Voiceover — Draft 1

VOICEOVER (V.O.)

New Haven... a city shrouded in darkness, where justice teeters on a fragile edge. In my heart beats the relentless pursuit of truth, driving me through the winding streets and shadowy alleyways.

I am Rob Meglio, known as The Nibbler, a detective consumed by an insatiable hunger for justice. Every step I take, the line between hunter and hunted blurs, as I sacrifice my own sanity in search of answers.

The weight of unanswered questions presses upon me, haunting my sleepless nights. The faces of the victims etch themselves into my soul, their cries for justice echoing through the empty streets.

Driven by motivations deeper than the pursuit of truth, it is a personal quest for redemption. To right the wrongs of the past, to protect the innocent from the grasp of darkness.

But as I traverse the treacherous path, doubts linger. The darkness within me, the obsession that gnaws at my soul, threatens to consume me entirely. Yet, I press forward, relentless and unyielding.

In the depths of my past lie memories that fuel my determination. A traumatic incident, a moment of powerlessness. They remind me of the stakes, the price I pay for justice.

With every heartbeat, I feel the weight of a pendant against my chest, a symbol of the loved ones lost and the justice I seek to restore. It guides me, even as the shadows threaten to engulf me.

This is my burden, my calling. A man of justice and ethics, walking the fine line between grit and charm. I am The Nibbler, a beacon of truth in the darkest corners of this city.

FADE OUT.
