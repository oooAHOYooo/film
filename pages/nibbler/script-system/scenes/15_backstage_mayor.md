INT. CITY HALL - GRAND BALLROOM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

Behind the chaotic scene in the grand ballroom, Rob, Max, Lucy, and the rest of the team make their way through the bustling backstage area. The Mayor, disheveled and clearly shaken by the public embarrassment, stands alone, trying to gather his thoughts.

ROB
(approaching the Mayor)
Mayor Anderson, we need to talk.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(looking up, surprised)
Detectives! What are you doing here?

LUCY
(earnestly)
We've seen the evidence, Mayor. We know you were set up. The Weevil is targeting you, and we're determined to stop him.

Mayor Anderson's eyes meet Rob's, searching for sincerity.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(sighs)
I can't believe it's come to this. But I've always trusted your team, and now I need you more than ever. You have my full support.

ROB
(firmly)
Thank you, Mayor. We won't let you down. We'll do whatever it takes to expose The Weevil's true motives and bring him to justice.

THE GHOST
(resolute)
We'll work discreetly and ensure your safety throughout the process.

Rob, The Ghost, and Lucy exchange determined glances, fueled by the Mayor's support.

ROB
(sincerely)
Thank you, Mayor. We won't disappoint you.

The team walks away, ready to face the challenges ahead, while Mayor Anderson watches them with a newfound hope.

MAYOR ANDERSON
Rob. Listen. There is one more thing. Come meet me in my office.
