EXT. BOATYARD - NIGHT

Rob and The Ghost set up their surveillance equipment in a secluded corner of the boatyard. The area is dimly lit, with the sound of water gently lapping against the docks.

ROB
(adjusting the surveillance camera)
Alright, Ghost. Let's hope this leads us to The Weevil.

THE GHOST
(nods)
We've got this, Rob. Trust in your instincts. Remember, you're the Nibbler.

They huddle close to the monitor, watching as the images flicker and adjust. Suddenly, the screen displays a series of vibrations and pulses.

ROB
(excitedly)
That's it! It's a message, Ghost. We need to unscramble it.

The Ghost quickly takes out a small device, connecting it to the surveillance system. With a few taps on the screen, the message is unscrambled, revealing a pathway for communication.

THE GHOST
(grinning)
It says "Mayor Grand Ballroom"

ROB
I got an idea.
