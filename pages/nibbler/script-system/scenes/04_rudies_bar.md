INT. RUDIES BAR

Rob sits at the bar, nursing a glass of whiskey. The dimly lit room is filled with the murmur of conversation and the clinking of glasses. As he takes a sip, his eyes scan the room, catching glimpses of admiration and respect from the patrons. The women at the bar give him coy smiles, while the men nod in acknowledgment.

(voiceover)
I couldn't tell anyone, for they wouldn't believe me. I had witnessed the truth, seen the Weevil in action. But without hard evidence, it was just my word against his.

Rob begins to read the tattered paper on the bar. The headline reads: "Mayor's Japan Scandal Resurfaces: A Dark Secret Threatens New Haven's Future."

Rob's eyes scan the article, his expression a mixture of concern and intrigue. The pub buzzes with activity around him, but he remains engrossed in the unfolding events.

ROB
(voiceover, whispering)
The mayor's scandal with Japan... it's more than just a stain on his reputation. I believe The Weevil is orchestrating this, pulling strings behind the scenes to manipulate the city's fate.

ROB
(voiceover, whispering)
The Weevil... a master manipulator. He thrives in chaos and feeds off the vulnerability of others. This scandal is just another little pawn in his twisted game.
