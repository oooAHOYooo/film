ROB
(voiceover)
Max, my trusted partner, known as the Ghost, has stood by my side through thick and thin. Together, we've faced countless dangers, fought against the forces of evil. He may be elusive and mysterious, but his loyalty is unwavering.

The patrons of the bar, both men and women, watch with admiration as the Ghost joins Rob at the bar. They share stories and exchange nods of camaraderie, a bond formed through their shared commitment to justice.

The GHOST raises his glass, the clinking sound cutting through the ambient noise, capturing the attention of the bar's patrons.

THE GHOST

To New Haven, a city on the verge of change. Together, we will emerge from the shadows, stronger and united.

The bar erupts in cheers and applause, the support of the community echoing through the air. The Nibbler and the Ghost, beloved by both ladies and men, have become symbols of hope in a city grappling with darkness.
