INT. CITY HALL - MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Rob sits across from Mayor Anderson, their expressions filled with a mix of tension and disbelief. The room is adorned with framed photographs and symbols of the Mayor's achievements, hinting at the darkness that lurks beneath.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(solemnly)
Rob, I need to tell you the truth about The Weevil. He's my brother, Mark.

Rob's eyes widen with shock, struggling to process the revelation.

ROB
(stammering)
Your brother? But why...?

MAYOR ANDERSON
(interrupting)
He always resented me, Rob. Resented that I became the Mayor, while he was sent away to Maine for his own well-being. Our family believed it was the best course of action after his mental health struggles.

Rob listens intently, trying to grasp the magnitude of the situation.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(continuing)
But Mark escaped. He took our family's fortune, and now he's using it to fuel his ambitions. He's paying for everything in cash, building a following of misguided individuals who believe in his vision of starting a new city, even if it means resorting to manipulation and cult-like tactics.

ROB
(in disbelief)
So, he's not just a criminal. He's a dangerous mastermind.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(nods gravely)
Yes, Rob. And if we don't stop him, he'll continue to grow in power and ruin everything we've worked for. He wants to tarnish my reputation, the reputation of our family, and create chaos in our city.

Rob's determination resurfaces as he processes the information.

ROB
(resolutely)
We won't let him succeed, Mayor. We'll expose his true nature and bring him down. The people need to know the truth.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(interrupting, voice trembling)
He always resented me, Rob. Deep down — Our family believed it was the best course — I thought I was doing what was best for him, for our family. I never imagined it would lead him down this path, embracing darkness and becoming the Weevil. I failed him, Rob. I failed as a brother.

Rob's eyes soften, his gaze filled with understanding and compassion. He reaches out a hand, offering support and empathy.

ROB
(softly)
Mayor Anderson, what's done is done — what's now — is now.

The Mayor's eyes well up with tears, his voice breaking as he continues.

Rob's grip tightens, offering reassurance and understanding.

ROB
(voice filled with empathy)
Mayor, it's easy to blame ourselves and question our choices in hindsight. We need to put an end to the Weevil's reign, not just for the city's sake, but for your peace of mind as well.

The Mayor takes a deep breath, visibly collecting himself, his voice filled with newfound determination.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(resolutely)
You're right, Rob. We can't let guilt or regret consume us. We have a duty to protect this city.

Rob nods, a genuine sense of camaraderie and shared purpose now connecting them.

ROB
(sincerely)
You're not alone in this, Mayor Anderson.

They share a brief moment of solidarity.

Rob rises from his chair, ready to face the challenge that lies ahead.

ROB
(confidently)
I won't let you down, Mayor. Together, we'll put an end to The Weevil's reign and restore peace to our city.

They exchange a determined look, united in their mission to stop the treacherous Weevil and save their community. They shake hands.

FADE OUT.
