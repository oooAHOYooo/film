INT. DETECTIVE OFFICE

Rob walks into the bustling detective office, his eyes filled with determination. He approaches a group of skeptical colleagues, including DETECTIVE JONES and DETECTIVE MILLER.

DETECTIVE JONES
(laughing)
Come on, Rob! The Weevil disappearing into thin air? You've got to be kidding me.

DETECTIVE MILLER
(smirking)
Yeah, Rob, maybe it's time you took a vacation. You've been chasing shadows for too long.

Rob clenches his fists, frustration evident on his face. He searches the room, hoping to find an ally in this sea of doubters. His eyes lock with MAX, his once-trusted friend and fellow vigilante, known as The Ghost. Who nods and follows Rob into his office.
