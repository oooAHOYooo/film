EXT. BACK OF RUDIES - LATER

Rob leans forward, his eyes filled with intensity as he addresses the Ghost. The busy ambiance of the diner fades into the background, as his voice takes on a more serious tone.

ROB
I was tailing a lead. It was late, and the shadows danced in the dimly lit alleyways. That's when I saw him, the Weevil, lurking in the darkness.

The Ghost's eyes widen with intrigue, realizing the significance of Rob's words.

GHOST
(with curiosity)
What did you see? Rob? Rob — Tell me everything.

Rob takes a deep breath, his gaze fixed on the tabletop as he recalls the encounter vividly.

ROB
He was like a phantom. I watched as he orchestrated a robbery, his precision and calculated movements leaving no room for error. But it wasn't just his actions that caught my attention, Ghost. It was his eyes, piercing and filled with a darkness that sent chills down my spine.

The Ghost leans in, his interest piqued by the description.

GHOST
Did he see you? Did he know you were there?

Rob shakes his head "Yes," a hint of frustration in his eyes.

ROB
Yes, but he vanished before I could make my move. I tried to follow, but he disappeared into thin air, leaving behind nothing but a lingering sense of unease. I knew I had to find him, to bring him to justice, but without concrete evidence, no one would believe me.

The Ghost reaches out, placing a comforting hand on Rob's shoulder.

GHOST
We'll find a way, Rob. We always do. We've faced countless challenges together, and this is just another hurdle we'll overcome. We'll gather the evidence, expose the Weevil for who he truly is.

Rob nods, a glimmer of determination returning to his eyes.

ROB
You're right. We can't let the shadows consume this city. The Weevil has his snout in everything. And now, this Japan scandal resurfaces. The Weevil's connection to the Japan scandal, it's all intertwined. I can feel it in my gut. We just need to connect the dots and reveal the truth.

The Ghost nods in agreement, his unwavering support evident in his gaze.

GHOST
We'll leave no stone unturned, Rob. Together, we'll bring down the Weevil and expose the web of deceit he's entangled in. We'll restore justice to this city, no matter what it takes.

As they finish their meal, Rob and the Ghost exchange a determined glance, a silent vow passing between them. Their quest to catch the Weevil and unravel the secrets of the Japan scandal has reached a new level of urgency.

They rise from the table, ready to face the challenges ahead, knowing that their partnership and relentless pursuit of the truth will lead them down a treacherous path. The Nibbler and the Ghost, bound by a shared mission, are prepared to fight the darkness and emerge victorious.

Rob pays the bill with cash and loose change.
