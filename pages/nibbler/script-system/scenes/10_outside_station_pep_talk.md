EXT. OUTSIDE OF THE POLICE STATION

Rob puts in more chewing tobacco and takes some deep breaths outside.

ROB
Maybe they're right. We don't know where he is. The chances of us catching the Weevil is slim.

THE GHOST
Are you kidding me Rob? You're the Nibbler — you are who got me into justice. (beat) Listen, we have all of this gear good to go — might as well give it a spin.

Rob looks at the gear and then back at Ghost.
