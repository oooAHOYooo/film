INT. SEASIDE PUB - NIGHT

The rustic charm of the seaside pub fills the air with lively music, as patrons joyously sing shanties in the background. Rob and The Ghost enter the bustling establishment, their eyes searching the room for Lucy, the spirited cocktail waitress they seek.

Amidst the lively atmosphere, a group of sailors energetically sing a sea shanty, their voices carrying the spirit of adventure and camaraderie.

ROB
(raising his voice over the shanties)
There she is! Over by the bar, serving drinks.

THE GHOST
(nods)
Let's approach her. We need to win her over amidst this jovial setting.

They weave through the crowd, guided by the infectious rhythm of the shanties. Finally, they reach the bar, where Lucy effortlessly pours drinks, her eyes shining with enthusiasm.

ROB
(beaming)
Lucy! Mind if we have a word amidst this merry chaos?

Lucy glances up, a smile breaking across her face as she spots Rob and The Ghost in the crowd.

LUCY
(excitedly)
Rob! I didn't expect to see you here. And who's this mysterious friend of yours?

THE GHOST
(grinning)
I'm The Ghost. We need to talk to you about something important. Can we find a quieter spot amidst the sea of music?

Lucy nods and leads them to a corner booth, where they can still feel the pulse of the shanties while finding a moment of respite.

Alright alright enough of that — what do I have to do?

THE GHOST
(nods)
There's a grand event coming up for the mayor, a lavish dinner where all the influential figures will be present. We need someone with your catering knowledge and network to help us secure tickets and gain access from the inside. Will you be our guide and lend us your expertise?

Lucy's eyes shine with determination, her passion now fueled by the prospect of utilizing her skills for the cause.

Rob looks at Lucy, slightly hesitant, but understanding the importance of her role.

ROB
(sincerely)
Lucy, I appreciate your dedication, but I can't ask you to risk your job or get involved in something potentially dangerous.

Lucy places a reassuring hand on Rob's arm, determination shining in her eyes.

LUCY
(confidently)
Rob, I've seen the shady dealings happening behind closed doors. I've witnessed the injustices firsthand. This is my chance to make a difference, and I won't let you face it alone. Trust me, I can handle it.

Rob's hesitancy turns into a grateful smile as he realizes Lucy's unwavering commitment.

Lucy, your expertise and connections will be invaluable. With you by our side, we can expose the corruption and bring justice to those who've evaded it for far too long.

Lucy takes a deep breath, determination etched on her face.

LUCY
(resolutely)
I won't let you down. Together, we'll infiltrate the event, gather evidence, and unveil the truth for all to see.

Rob, The Ghost, and Lucy clasp hands, forming a united front against the forces of corruption. In the background, the lively shanties continue, infusing their spirits with determination and resolve.

ROB
(sincerely)
Thank you, Lucy. Together, amidst the chorus of shanties, we will sail towards justice and expose the corruption that plagues our city.

They exchange a final glance, knowing that their collaboration will be instrumental in unmasking the truth and bringing about the change their city so desperately needs.

FADE OUT.
