EXT. ABANDONED SHIP YARD

He finds a series of post-it notes on the ground — and it eventually leads him to a man sitting behind a desk in the middle of the shipyard. Upon further notice — Rob notices that it is indeed the Weevil himself!

ROB
Freeze!

Before Rob could make his move and take notice — The Weevil makes a grand disappearance. A dust of smoke and puff — he is out of frame — leaving Rob standing in a stupor.
