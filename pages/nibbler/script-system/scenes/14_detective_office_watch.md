LUCY
(astonished)
The Weevil's true motive... it's not just about committing crimes. He wants to humiliate the Mayor, to bring him down in front of everyone.

ROB
(determined)
We can't let him succeed. We need to stop The Weevil and save the Mayor's reputation.

With a renewed sense of purpose, the team springs into action, preparing to confront The Weevil and unveil his true intentions.

FADE OUT.
