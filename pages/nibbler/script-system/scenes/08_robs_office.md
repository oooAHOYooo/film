INT. ROB'S OFFICE

Rob grabs a red string from a nearby table and connects the newspaper clipping to another set of articles. The string weaves through various leads, tying together the pieces of the puzzle.

ROB
(pointing to the connections)
These are the mayoral elections, the city contracts, and the recent increase in criminal activity. There's a pattern here. We just need to find the missing link.

GHOST
The robberies — are they in any particular order?

ROB
(considering)
It's possible. The Weevil has a way of manipulating others to do his bidding. We'll dig deeper into his connections, follow the trail.

The Ghost reaches into a hidden compartment of his suit and retrieves a set of high-tech gadgets.

GHOST
(offering the gadgets)
We need to gear up. The Weevil won't go down without a fight. It's time to level the playing field.

Rob takes the gadgets, his eyes shining with anticipation.
