I/E.

Rob's big ass eyes go through a magnifying glass. He scours the wall. Dramatic eerie music fills the air. Rob reaches inside his coat and begins to put on a pair of dusting gloves as he gently collects a fingerprint and hair with a tweaser. He puts it in his coat pocket.

ROB
(voiceover)
They call me "The Nibbler," the one who takes a bite out of crime. The people of this city have seen me in action, witnessed my dedication to keeping their sidewalks safe. They've come to trust in my abilities, my unwavering determination. And this is what motivates me.

Rob scratches notes on his notepad.

INT. DIMLY LIT PRIVATE OFFICE - POLICE STATION - NIGHT

A hazy room filled with flickering fluorescent lights and weary detectives. ROB MEGLIO, a seasoned detective with haunted eyes and a troubled past, sits at a cluttered desk, poring over case files.

ROB
(voiceover)
Assigned to investigate a series of high-profile robberies, I became consumed with catching The Weevil. An elusive figure who operated outside the shadows of the law, leaving behind a trail of mystery and chaos. But little did I know, the truth would be far more twisted than I could ever imagine.

EXT. OUTSIDE OF THE POLICE STATION

Rob takes out his little pistol on one hand — and handcuffs on the other.

ROB
Freeze!

Before Rob could make his move and take notice — The Weevil makes a grand disappearance. A dust of smoke and puff — he is out of frame — leaving Rob standing in a stupor.

INT. RUDIES BAR

Rob sits at the bar, nursing a glass of whiskey. The dimly lit room is filled with the murmur of conversation and the clinking of glasses. As he takes a sip, his eyes scan the room, catching glimpses of admiration and respect from the patrons. The women at the bar give him coy smiles, while the men nod in acknowledgment.

ROB
(voiceover)
I couldn't tell anyone, for they wouldn't believe me. I had witnessed the truth, seen the Weevil in action. But without hard evidence, it was just my word against his.

Rob begins to read the tattered paper on the bar. The headline reads: "Mayor's Japan Scandal Resurfaces: A Dark Secret Threatens New Haven's Future."

Rob's eyes scan the article, his expression a mixture of concern and intrigue. The pub buzzes with activity around him, but he remains engrossed in the unfolding events.

ROB
(voiceover, whispering)
The mayor's scandal with Japan... it's more than just a stain on his reputation. I believe The Weevil is orchestrating this, pulling strings behind the scenes to manipulate the city's fate.

ROB
(voiceover, whispering)
The Weevil... a master manipulator. He thrives in chaos and feeds off the vulnerability of others. This scandal is just another little pawn in his twisted game.

EXT. BACK OF RUDIES - LATER

Rob leans forward, his eyes filled with intensity as he addresses the Ghost. The busy ambiance of the diner fades into the background, as his voice takes on a more serious tone.

ROB
I was tailing a lead. It was late, and the shadows danced in the dimly lit alleyways. That's when I saw him, the Weevil, lurking in the darkness.

The Ghost's eyes widen with intrigue, realizing the significance of Rob's words.

GHOST
(with curiosity)
What did you see? Rob? Rob — Tell me everything.

Rob takes a deep breath, his gaze fixed on the tabletop as he recalls the encounter vividly.

ROB
He was like a phantom. I watched as he orchestrated a robbery, his precision and calculated movements leaving no room for error. But it wasn't just his actions that caught my attention, Ghost. It was his eyes, piercing and filled with a darkness that sent chills down my spine.

The Ghost leans in, his interest piqued by the description.

GHOST
Did he see you? Did he know you were there?

Rob shakes his head "Yes," a hint of frustration in his eyes.

ROB
Yes, but he vanished before I could make my move. I tried to follow, but he disappeared into thin air, leaving behind nothing but a lingering sense of unease. I knew I had to find him, to bring him to justice, but without concrete evidence, no one would believe me.

The Ghost reaches out, placing a comforting hand on Rob's shoulder.

GHOST
We'll find a way, Rob. We always do. We've faced countless challenges together, and this is just another hurdle we'll overcome. We'll gather the evidence, expose the Weevil for who he truly is.

Rob nods, a glimmer of determination returning to his eyes.

ROB
You're right. We can't let the shadows consume this city. The Weevil has his snout in everything. And now, this Japan scandal resurfaces. The Weevil's connection to the Japan scandal, it's all intertwined. I can feel it in my gut. We just need to connect the dots and reveal the truth.

The Ghost nods in agreement, his unwavering support evident in his gaze.

GHOST
We'll leave no stone unturned, Rob. Together, we'll bring down the Weevil and expose the web of deceit he's entangled in. We'll restore justice to this city, no matter what it takes.

As they finish their meal, Rob and the Ghost exchange a determined glance, a silent vow passing between them. Their quest to catch the Weevil and unravel the secrets of the Japan scandal has reached a new level of urgency.

They rise from the table, ready to face the challenges ahead, knowing that their partnership and relentless pursuit of the truth will lead them down a treacherous path. The Nibbler and the Ghost, bound by a shared mission, are prepared to fight the darkness and emerge victorious.

Rob pays the bill with cash and loose change.

DETECTIVE JONES
(laughing)
Come on, Rob! The Weevil disappearing into thin air? You've got to be kidding me.

DETECTIVE MILLER
(smirking)
Yeah, Rob, maybe it's time you took a vacation. You've been chasing shadows for too long.

Rob clenches his fists, frustration evident on his face. He searches the room, hoping to find an ally in this sea of doubters. His eyes lock with MAX, his once-trusted friend and fellow vigilante, known as The Ghost. Who nods and follows Rob into his office.

Rob grabs a red string from a nearby table and connects the newspaper clipping to another set of articles. The string weaves through various leads, tying together the pieces of the puzzle.

ROB
(pointing to the connections)
These are the mayoral elections, the city contracts, and the recent increase in criminal activity. There's a pattern here. We just need to find the missing link.

GHOST
The robberies — are they in any particular order?

ROB
(considering)
It's possible. The Weevil has a way of manipulating others to do his bidding. We'll dig deeper into his connections, follow the trail.

The Ghost reaches into a hidden compartment of his suit and retrieves a set of high-tech gadgets.

GHOST
(offering the gadgets)
We need to gear up. The Weevil won't go down without a fight. It's time to level the playing field.

DETECTIVE BOSS
(firmly)
What the hell do you two think you're doing? I thought I made it clear that you were off this case!

ROB
(defiantly)
We have evidence, sir. We know where The Weevil's hiding.

DETECTIVE BOSS
Oh you do?

ROB
Yes.

DETECTIVE MILLER
And where's that, Nibbler?

DETECTIVE BOSS
(gesturing for Miller to shut up)
Let's have some respect for the Nibbler boys — he is the town's hero — but for what

THE GHOST
Not now sir.

DETECTIVE BOSS
(in a mocking tone)
You're right Max — not now — okay Rob — go out and find the Weevil.

Rob puts in more chewing tobacco and takes some deep breaths outside.

ROB
Maybe they're right. We don't know where he is. The chances of us catching the Weevil is slim.

THE GHOST
Are you kidding me Rob? You're the Nibbler — you are who got me into justice. (beat) Listen, we have all of this gear good to go — might as well give it a spin.

Rob looks at the gear and then back at Ghost.

### Scene 11: Boatyard Surveillance

EXT. BOATYARD - NIGHT

Rob and The Ghost set up their surveillance equipment in a secluded corner of the boatyard. The area is dimly lit, with the sound of water gently lapping against the docks.

ROB

Alright, Ghost. Let's hope this leads us to The Weevil.

THE GHOST
(nods)
We've got this, Rob. Trust in your instincts. Remember, you're the Nibbler.

They huddle close to the monitor, watching as the images flicker and adjust. Suddenly, the screen displays a series of vibrations and pulses.

ROB
(excitedly)
That's it! It's a message, Ghost. We need to unscramble it.

The Ghost quickly takes out a small device, connecting it to the surveillance system. With a few taps on the screen, the message is unscrambled, revealing a pathway for communication.

THE GHOST
(grinning)
It says "Mayor Grand Ballroom"

ROB
I got an idea.

Amidst the lively atmosphere, a group of sailors energetically sing a sea shanty, their voices carrying the spirit of adventure and camaraderie.

ROB
(raising his voice over the shanties)
There she is! Over by the bar, serving drinks.

Let's approach her. We need to win her over amidst this jovial setting.

They weave through the crowd, guided by the infectious rhythm of the shanties. Finally, they reach the bar, where Lucy effortlessly pours drinks, her eyes shining with enthusiasm.

ROB
(beaming)
Lucy! Mind if we have a word amidst this merry chaos?

Lucy glances up, a smile breaking across her face as she spots Rob and The Ghost in the crowd.

LUCY
(excitedly)
Rob! I didn't expect to see you here. And who's this mysterious friend of yours?

THE GHOST
(grinning)
I'm The Ghost. We need to talk to you about something important. Can we find a quieter spot amidst the sea of music?

Indeed, Lucy. We know about your fiery passion for justice and your yearning to make a difference. We believe you can be an invaluable ally in our cause.

THE GHOST
(earnestly)
We're assembling a team to fight against corruption and dismantle criminal networks that threaten our city. We've witnessed your determination and we need someone like you by our side.

Lucy's eyes widen with a mixture of surprise and excitement, her spirit seemingly ignited by the lively atmosphere surrounding them.

LUCY
(sarcastic)
You've noticed? I've always longed to make a meaningful impact, to fight for justice. But how can a simple cocktail waitress like me be of any help?

ROB
(sincerely)
Lucy, it's precisely your unwavering dedication and indomitable spirit that make you invaluable. We need individuals from all walks of life, ready to stand up against corruption. Your unique perspective and skills are essential to our mission.

LUCY
Alright alright enough of that — what do I have to do?

THE GHOST
(nods)
There's a grand event coming up for the mayor, a lavish dinner where all the influential figures will be present. We need someone with your catering knowledge and network to help us secure tickets and gain access from the inside. Will you be our guide and lend us your expertise?

Lucy's eyes shine with determination, her passion now fueled by the prospect of utilizing her skills for the cause.

Rob looks at Lucy, slightly hesitant, but understanding the importance of her role.

ROB
(sincerely)
Lucy, I appreciate your dedication, but I can't ask you to risk your job or get involved in something potentially dangerous.

Lucy places a reassuring hand on Rob's arm, determination shining in her eyes.

LUCY
(confidently)
Rob, I've seen the shady dealings happening behind closed doors. I've witnessed the injustices firsthand. This is my chance to make a difference, and I won't let you face it alone. Trust me, I can handle it.

Rob's hesitancy turns into a grateful smile as he realizes Lucy's unwavering commitment.

I won't let you down. Together, we'll infiltrate the event, gather evidence, and unveil the truth for all to see.

Mayor ANDERSON, a charismatic and well-spoken leader, stands confidently on the stage, ready to address the crowd. The Weevil, disguised in a sleek suit, stands among the guests, blending seamlessly into the crowd.

THE WEEVIL
(to himself, smirking)
Tonight, Mayor Anderson, your downfall begins.

The lights dim, and the spotlight shines on Mayor Anderson as he steps up to the podium, greeted by a round of applause.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(loudly)
Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us tonight. We gather here to celebrate the progress our city has made.

As Mayor Anderson continues his speech, The Weevil slips through the crowd, unnoticed. He skillfully infiltrates the backstage area, where the event staff prepares for the evening's entertainment.

The Weevil approaches a technician, pretending to be a stagehand.

INT. CITY HALL - GRAND BALLROOM - CONTINUOUS

Mayor Anderson confidently addresses the crowd, unaware of the imminent danger lurking behind the scenes. Suddenly, the sound system crackles, and a distorted voice fills the room.

The crowd falls silent, their attention drawn to the unexpected interruption. The Weevil's voice echoes through the grand ballroom, capturing everyone's attention.

The large screens on either side of the stage flicker to life, revealing a live video feed from the backstage area. The crowd gasps as they witness Mayor Anderson's private conversation with a notorious criminal, captured on camera.

The footage shows the Mayor accepting bribes, making backroom deals, and betraying the trust of the city's inhabitants. Shock and disbelief wash over the audience.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(stammering)
No... this is a setup! I would never...

We've seen the evidence, Mayor. We know you were set up. The Weevil is targeting you, and we're determined to stop him.

---

INT. CITY HALL - MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Rob sits across from Mayor Anderson, their expressions filled with a mix of tension and disbelief. The room is adorned with framed photographs and symbols of the Mayor's achievements, hinting at the darkness that lurks beneath.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(solemnly)
Rob, I need to tell you the truth about The Weevil. He's my brother, Mark.

Rob's eyes widen with shock, struggling to process the revelation.

ROB
(stammering)
Your brother? But why...?

MAYOR ANDERSON
(interrupting)
He always resented me, Rob. Resented that I became the Mayor, while he was sent away to Maine for his own well-being. Our family believed it was the best course of action after his mental health struggles.

Rob listens intently, trying to grasp the magnitude of the situation.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(continuing)
But Mark escaped. He took our family's fortune, and now he's using it to fuel his ambitions. He's paying for everything in cash, building a following of misguided individuals who believe in his vision of starting a new city, even if it means resorting to manipulation and cult-like tactics.

ROB
(in disbelief)
So, he's not just a criminal. He's a dangerous mastermind.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(nods gravely)
Yes, Rob. And if we don't stop him, he'll continue to grow in power and ruin everything we've worked for. He wants to tarnish my reputation, the reputation of our family, and create chaos in our city.

Rob's determination resurfaces as he processes the information.

ROB
(resolutely)
We won't let him succeed, Mayor. We'll expose his true nature and bring him down. The people need to know the truth.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(interrupting, voice trembling)
He always resented me, Rob. Deep down — Our family believed it was the best course — I thought I was doing what was best for him, for our family. I never imagined it would lead him down this path, embracing darkness and becoming the Weevil. I failed him, Rob. I failed as a brother.

Rob's eyes soften, his gaze filled with understanding and compassion. He reaches out a hand, offering support and empathy.

ROB
(softly)
Mayor Anderson, what's done is done — what's now — is now.

The Mayor's eyes well up with tears, his voice breaking as he continues.

Rob's grip tightens, offering reassurance and understanding.

ROB
(voice filled with empathy)
Mayor, it's easy to blame ourselves and question our choices in hindsight. We need to put an end to the Weevil's reign, not just for the city's sake, but for your peace of mind as well.

The Mayor takes a deep breath, visibly collecting himself, his voice filled with newfound determination.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(resolutely)
You're right, Rob. We can't let guilt or regret consume us. We have a duty to protect this city.

Rob nods, a genuine sense of camaraderie and shared purpose now connecting them.

ROB
(sincerely)
You're not alone in this, Mayor Anderson.

They share a brief moment of solidarity.

Rob rises from his chair, ready to face the challenge that lies ahead.

ROB
(confidently)
I won't let you down, Mayor. Together, we'll put an end to The Weevil's reign and restore peace to our city.

They exchange a determined look, united in their mission to stop the treacherous Weevil and save their community. They shake hands.

FADE OUT.

Rob, The Ghost, Mayor Anderson, and Lucy stealthily move through the boatyard, their eyes scanning the surroundings for any sign of The Weevil. Suddenly, they find themselves surrounded by a group of henchmen dressed as mini weevils, each holding menacing bats and exuding an air of seriousness.

ROB
(gritting his teeth)
We've walked right into a trap!

THE GHOST
(undaunted)
Stay focused. We can handle this.

Mayor Anderson and Lucy exchange determined glances, ready to face whatever lies ahead. But their attention is quickly drawn to The Weevil, who steps forward, donned in a complex weevil costume that conceals his true identity.

THE WEEVIL
(chuckling)
Ah, my dear adversaries, you've fallen right into my trap. Prepare to face the might of the weevils!

With a swift motion, The Weevil strikes a large magnet hidden in his costume, causing all the guns in the team's possession to be forcefully drawn towards him, stuck to the magnet's surface.

LUCY
(startled)
Our guns! He's disarmed us!

Mayor Anderson's eyes narrow with determination as he assesses the situation.

MAYOR ANDERSON
We may have lost our guns, but we still have each other.

The team engages in a fierce hand-to-hand combat, skillfully countering the attacks of the weevil henchmen. Despite the intense fight, The Weevil seizes the opportunity and escapes, making a swift exit just before Rob, The Ghost, Mayor Anderson, and Lucy can reach him.

ROB
(frustrated)
He slipped away again!

THE GHOST
(gritting his teeth)
We'll get him next time. For now, we need to ensure everyone's safety.

As the team regroups, they notice The Weevil's henchmen retreating, carrying a dazed and bound group of civilians, held hostage within their ranks.

LUCY
(concerned)
We can't let them get away with innocent lives in their clutches!

ROB
(resolute)
We won't. Let's focus on rescuing the hostages first. We'll deal with The Weevil later.

With determination and a shared sense of urgency, the team pursues the retreating henchmen, chasing them through the boatyard. Despite their best efforts, The Weevil's minions manage to escape, disappearing into the night.

EXT. BOATYARD - LATER

Rob, The Ghost, Mayor Anderson, and Lucy stand amidst the quiet boatyard, catching their breaths and assessing the aftermath of their encounter.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(earnestly)
We may not have captured The Weevil tonight, but we saved innocent lives. Our fight against him continues.

ROB
(nodding)
Indeed. We won't rest until justice is served and our city is safe from his corruption.

The team exchanges determined glances, understanding that their battle against The Weevil and the criminal networks he represents is far from over. They remain resolved to expose the truth, protect their community, and bring an end to the reign of the weevils.

FADE OUT.

INT. MAYOR'S OFFICE - DAY

Rob and Mayor Anderson sit across from each other, the tension from their previous conversation lingering in the air. The mayor takes a deep breath and leans forward, a glimmer of determination in his eyes.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(earnestly)
Rob, I've been thinking. Our fight against The Weevil and the other cult leaders is not something we can face alone. We need to unite the city, to show them that we are committed to eradicating this corruption. We need to form a team — a symbol of hope and strength.

Rob's eyebrows raise in surprise, intrigued by the mayor's sudden change in perspective.

ROB
(curious)
A team? What do you have in mind, Mayor?

MAYOR ANDERSON
(sincerely)
I propose we create a public alliance — a crew dedicated to fighting against The Weevil and the various cult leaders that threaten our city. We will gather individuals who share our passion for justice and create a force to be reckoned with.

Rob's initial skepticism fades, replaced by a growing sense of enthusiasm.

ROB
(enthusiastically)
You mean assemble a team of like-minded individuals, each bringing their unique skills to the table? A team that stands against corruption, protecting the innocent and upholding justice?

MAYOR ANDERSON
(nodding)
Exactly, Rob. Together, we can demonstrate that the city will not tolerate these criminal networks. By forming a united front, we send a powerful message that we will not back down until every last trace of corruption is rooted out.

Rob leans back, contemplating the idea. He realizes the potential impact of such a team, not only in combating the immediate threats but also in inspiring the community.

ROB
(determined)
I'm in, Mayor. Let's make this alliance a reality. We'll find the brave souls who are willing to join the fight, who refuse to let the weevils and the cult leaders dictate our city's fate.

Mayor Anderson smiles, a genuine spark of hope igniting within him.

MAYOR ANDERSON
(exuberant)
That's the spirit, Rob! Together, we'll form a beacon of hope for our city, inspiring others to stand against the darkness. We will reclaim our streets and rebuild the trust that has been shattered.

They share a moment of shared determination, knowing that they are embarking on a mission that extends beyond themselves. Their actions will reverberate throughout the city, encouraging others to rise up and join their cause.

ROB
(resolute)
