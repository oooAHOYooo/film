EXT. WOOD — NIGHT / AFTERMATH

Henri only remembers their eyes. How unlike human they were. Creature-like—but by a creator who could never love the creature.

Could they ever turn back? Are they too far gone from their original form—without hope? Do these creatures truly come from hatred—or are they results of decisions that left them in this horrid condition?

They were so angular—disturbing. Their arcs like mini bridges. Beneath the bridge, a moonlit baseball—slowing up and down, bouncing almost. Ping pong eyes.

PROFESSOR

Aye! Do you know who we are? Do you know who has sent us into this wood? We demand to talk to an elder of this village.

An elder? Are these creatures civilized?

PROFESSOR

This is a great time to fly.

HENRI

Why did you even think I could fly in the first place? What gave you such an impression?
