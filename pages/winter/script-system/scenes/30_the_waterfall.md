EXT. WOOD — DAY

YoHanse runs and runs through the thicket. He jumps over rivers and holes, fixated on the creature rapidly moving through the treelines.

Suddenly a waterfall comes into focus. YoHanse stops. He turns around. The creature remains—panting, gasping for air—nestled high in a tree branch overlooking the waterfall.

YoHanse calls out in Machulu: Spe Spe Ek Kah.

The creature remains perched on the tree branch in a crouched position. Slightly laughing. He takes from his leaf backpack—YoHanse's stone bird.

YOHANSE

Now you know that I cannot let you do that. What is it that you want? Quickly tell me now—I am in a bit of a hurry.

CREATURE

You!

The creature's finger points at YoHanse. He signals for him to jump off the cliff.

YoHanse jumps.
