EXT. OUTPOST — DAY

PROFESSOR

That's a good guess dear Henri. I like the way your mind navigates new information. Fresh, innocent, unassuming.

The Professor looks up at the structure once more, then back at Henri.

PROFESSOR

I am afraid that you are wrong. We are here to learn.

HENRI

To learn what?

PROFESSOR

Well, we were talking.

YoHanse looks at the Professor and gives him a hug.

PROFESSOR

We would like to learn if you could fly.
