EXT. WOOD — DAY

YoHanse looks up and sees them swinging from tree top to tree top. These creatures have fantastic mobility.

As there are many, YoHanse with all of his might tries to focus on one—only one—of the unknown and unnamed creatures. He is able to do so. In almost slow motion, a creature makes a giant leap from off a tree branch into a crouched landing position. It then proceeds to spear up toward the branches and ceiling.

YoHanse begins to run after this creature—who stole his bird statue.
