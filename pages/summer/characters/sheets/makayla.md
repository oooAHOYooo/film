# Makayla

- 22. Janice's step-daughter. Pre-med dropout. Currently "figuring things out."
- She dropped out because she couldn't stop asking questions her professors didn't want to answer. She's not a rebel — she's genuinely curious in a way that makes structured learning feel suffocating. 
- She has a deep disstate for adults who think they know more than they do. She takes everything at surface level - no science is worth believing because it is just a bunch of lab coats opinons. 
- She touches the crystal without fear because she doesn't filter experience through caution. She processes by doing, not analyzing. This is the opposite of Dallas, which is why they work well together.
- Her mother died - and father remarried Janice - but he died too - now she is stuck with a stranger who calls her daughter. 
- She is fiercely protective of her brother Asher - often speaks for him - thinks highly of him, despite the rest of the world wanting to cast him out as a mute.
