# Dominic

- 43 years old. Lost his wife and young son in 7 years ago.
- Took in Mr. Mike (his father-in-law) afterward. 
- Suffers guilt. 
- The church, the life group, the fellowship lunches, the cooking, the Costco runs — this is how Dominic keeps moving. If he stops doing things for people, he'll have to sit with what happened.
- He builds community around himself compulsively. Dallas is his newest project. He doesn't know it yet, but Dallas is the first person he's met who understands loss without needing it explained.
