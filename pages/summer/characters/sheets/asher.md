# Asher

- 15. Makayla's younger brother. Quiet. Observant.
- He's the one who notices patterns — the burn marks leading to the window, the trail of crystals. He doesn't say much about what he sees. He just sees it.
- He sketches constantly. After the events of the film, he starts drawing the creatures from memory. He'll never stop.
