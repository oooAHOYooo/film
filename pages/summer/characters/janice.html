          <h1>Janice</h1>
          <ul>
          <li>45. Dominic's sister. Works at the Branford museum.</li>
          <li>Practical, impatient, loving in a loud way. She doesn't have time for mystery — she has two kids, a job, and a brother who takes in strays (Dallas, Mr. Mike, half the church).</li>
          <li>She never sees the creatures directly. She sees the burn marks, the strange weather, her daughter running into the grass. She represents the town — the people who live next to the extraordinary and never look closely enough to see it.</li>
