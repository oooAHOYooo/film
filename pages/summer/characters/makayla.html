          <ul>
          <li>22. Janice's daughter. Pre-med dropout. Currently &quot;figuring things out.&quot;</li>
          <li>She dropped out because she couldn't stop asking questions her professors didn't want to answer. She's not a rebel — she's genuinely curious in a way that makes structured learning feel suffocating.</li>
          <li>She touches the crystal without fear because she doesn't filter experience through caution. She processes by doing, not analyzing. This is the opposite of Dallas, which is why they work well together.</li>
          <li>She has no grief arc. She's the only main character who isn't carrying loss. That's why the creatures respond to her — she's resonant. No interference. Clean signal.</li>
