          <h1>Mr. Mike</h1>
          <ul>
          <li>78. Dominic's father-in-law.</li>
          <li>Former merchant marine radio operator. Spent 30 years on ships in Long Island Sound and the Atlantic. He heard the Hum decades ago — on a still night off the coast of Branford, his radio picked up a signal on 115.3 MHz that wasn't on any chart. He followed it. He saw something in the water — a glow beneath the surface, moving toward the marshes. He never reported it. Nobody would have believed him.</li>
          <li>The frequency lodged in him. Over the years, it degraded his cognition — not like normal dementia, but targeted. His memory for everyday things eroded, but his recall of the frequency is perfect. He can reproduce the exact tone by humming. He scratches the numbers because his hands remember what his mind is losing.</li>
          <li>When he says &quot;She's here&quot; or &quot;They're coming&quot; — he's not confused. He's the most accurate sensor in the house.</li>
