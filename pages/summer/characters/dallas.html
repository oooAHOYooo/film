          <ul>
          <li>38 years old. Hired at Quinnipiac to start next semester.</li>
          <li>His wife, Elena, died 2 years ago. Cancer, but she was also an infrasound researcher who spent years in high-exposure acoustic environments. Dallas has never said the two are connected out loud.</li>
          <li>He chose Branford because Elena had circled it on a map once. She never told him why. He found the map after she died.</li>
          <li>He doesn't talk about Elena to anyone. The photo sticker on the Oscillio is the only visible evidence she existed. Everything else is in boxes he hasn't opened.</li>
          <li>He's not antisocial — he's hollowed out. Dominic fills the space because Dallas doesn't resist it.</li>
