<ul>
<li>38 years old. Hired at Quinnipiac to start next semester.</li>
<li>His wife, Elena, died 2 years ago. Cancer, but she was also an infrasound researcher who spent years in high-exposure acoustic environments. Dallas has never said the two are connected out loud.</li>
<li>He chose Branford because Elena had circled it on a map once. She never told him why. He found the map after she died.</li>
<li>He doesn't talk about Elena to anyone. The photo sticker on the Oscillio is the only visible evidence she existed. Everything else is in boxes he hasn't opened.</li>
<li>He's not antisocial — he's hollowed out. Dominic fills the space because Dallas doesn't resist it.</li>
</ul></section>

<section class="sheet" id="dominic"><h2><a href="dominic.html">Dominic</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>43 years old. Lost his wife and young son in 7 years ago.</li>
<li>Took in Mr. Mike (his father-in-law) afterward.</li>
<li>Suffers guilt.</li>
<li>The church, the life group, the fellowship lunches, the cooking, the Costco runs — this is how Dominic keeps moving. If he stops doing things for people, he'll have to sit with what happened.</li>
<li>He builds community around himself compulsively. Dallas is his newest project. He doesn't know it yet, but Dallas is the first person he's met who understands loss without needing it explained.</li>
</ul></section>

<section class="sheet" id="makayla"><h2><a href="makayla.html">Makayla</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>22. Janice's daughter. Pre-med dropout. Currently &quot;figuring things out.&quot;</li>
<li>She dropped out because she couldn't stop asking questions her professors didn't want to answer. She's not a rebel — she's genuinely curious in a way that makes structured learning feel suffocating.</li>
<li>She touches the crystal without fear because she doesn't filter experience through caution. She processes by doing, not analyzing. This is the opposite of Dallas, which is why they work well together.</li>
<li>She has no grief arc. She's the only main character who isn't carrying loss. That's why the creatures respond to her — she's resonant. No interference. Clean signal.</li>
</ul></section>

<section class="sheet" id="asher"><h2><a href="asher.html">Asher</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>15. Makayla's younger brother. Quiet. Observant.</li>
<li>He's the one who notices patterns — the burn marks leading to the window, the trail of crystals. He doesn't say much about what he sees. He just sees it.</li>
<li>He sketches constantly. After the events of the film, he starts drawing the creatures from memory. He'll never stop.</li>
</ul></section>

<section class="sheet" id="mr-mike"><h2><a href="mr-mike.html">Mr. Mike</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>78. Dominic's father-in-law.</li>
<li>Former merchant marine radio operator. Spent 30 years on ships in Long Island Sound and the Atlantic. He heard the Hum decades ago — on a still night off the coast of Branford, his radio picked up a signal on 115.3 MHz that wasn't on any chart. He followed it. He saw something in the water — a glow beneath the surface, moving toward the marshes. He never reported it. Nobody would have believed him.</li>
<li>The frequency lodged in him. Over the years, it degraded his cognition — not like normal dementia, but targeted. His memory for everyday things eroded, but his recall of the frequency is perfect. He can reproduce the exact tone by humming. He scratches the numbers because his hands remember what his mind is losing.</li>
<li>When he says &quot;She's here&quot; or &quot;They're coming&quot; — he's not confused. He's the most accurate sensor in the house.</li>
</ul></section>

<section class="sheet" id="janice"><h2><a href="janice.html">Janice</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>45. Dominic's sister. Works at the Branford museum.</li>
<li>Practical, impatient, loving in a loud way. She doesn't have time for mystery — she has two kids, a job, and a brother who takes in strays (Dallas, Mr. Mike, half the church).</li>
<li>She never sees the creatures directly. She sees the burn marks, the strange weather, her daughter running into the grass. She represents the town — the people who live next to the extraordinary and never look closely enough to see it.</li>
</ul></section>

<section class="sheet" id="howie"><h2><a href="howie.html">Howie</a></h2>

<ul>
<li>Janice's dog. Small. Anxious. Loves Dallas immediately.</li>
<li>Animals hear frequencies humans can't. Howie has been hearing the Singers his whole life. He's not afraid of the hum — he's afraid of the silence. When the Eaters are near, Howie goes still. That's the tell.</li>
