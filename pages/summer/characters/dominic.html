          <h1>Dominic</h1>
          <ul>
          <li>43 years old. Lost his wife and young son in 7 years ago.</li>
          <li>Took in Mr. Mike (his father-in-law) afterward.</li>
          <li>Suffers guilt.</li>
          <li>The church, the life group, the fellowship lunches, the cooking, the Costco runs — this is how Dominic keeps moving. If he stops doing things for people, he'll have to sit with what happened.</li>
          <li>He builds community around himself compulsively. Dallas is his newest project. He doesn't know it yet, but Dallas is the first person he's met who understands loss without needing it explained.</li>
