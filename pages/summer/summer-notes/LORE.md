# Creatures in the Tall Grass — Lore Bible

*None of this is exposition. None of it goes in dialogue. This is what YOU know as the filmmaker so that every shot, every sound cue, every actor direction has weight behind it. The audience should feel this without anyone explaining it.*

## The Marsh — Why Branford

The Branford salt marsh sits where the Branford River meets Long Island Sound. Salt marshes are acoustic anomalies — the dense spartina grass, the shallow tidal channels, the mineral-heavy soil all create natural waveguides that trap and amplify low-frequency sound. Indigenous Mattabeseck people called the area something that roughly translates to "the place that hums back." European settlers ignored this. The marsh was drained, farmed, abandoned, and eventually grew wild again. The tall grass reclaimed it.

The creatures didn't come to Branford. They've always been in the marsh. The marsh grew around them.

## The Creatures (The Singers)

**What they are:** Ancient organisms — not extraterrestrial in the UFO sense, but not from any taxonomy humans have built. They predate the marsh. They may predate the continent. Think of them the way you'd think of deep-ocean vent organisms: life that evolved in conditions so different from ours that they seem alien, but they've been here longer than we have.

**How they live:** They exist in the root system of the salt marsh. The tall grass is not their habitat — it's their body. The spartina grass grows the way it does because the creatures' hum feeds the root network. The grass is taller here, denser here, more golden here because something underneath is singing to it. The creatures and the marsh are symbiotic. The grass protects them. They feed the grass with vibration.

**How they communicate:** Through resonance. The holes in their backs are not lungs — they're instruments. Each creature has a unique tonal signature, like a fingerprint made of sound. When they hum together, the frequencies stack into chords. A group of creatures in harmony can bend the air around them, create localized pressure changes, even produce visible light (bioluminescence triggered by specific frequency thresholds). This is the golden glow.

**The crystals:** Compressed resonance. When a creature hums in one place long enough — years, decades — the mineral salts in the marsh soil crystallize around the frequency. The crystals are fossilized sound. They vibrate at the creature's home frequency. That's why Makayla's hair stands up when she touches one — it's still humming. The crystals are also how the creatures navigate: they leave tonal breadcrumbs. A crystal is a waypoint, a marker, a "someone was here."

**Life cycle:** The creatures live long — centuries, possibly longer. They're small because they don't need to be big. Size is for predators and prey that operate in physical space. The creatures operate in acoustic space. Their power is frequency, not mass. The young ones glow brighter but hum quieter. The elders glow dimmer but their hum can paralyze a human nervous system.

**Why the injured one was dying:** It was cut off from the chord. A creature alone can't sustain its own resonance — it needs at least one other to create a harmonic. Alone, its frequency decays. Its glow fades. The back-holes lose pressure. It's not bleeding out — it's going silent. That's death for a Singer: silence.

---

## The Predators (The Eaters)

**What they are:** The same species. Or they were, once.

A Singer that is cut off from the chord for too long doesn't just die — it inverts. The frequency collapses inward. Instead of producing sound, it begins to consume it. The back-holes seal over. The glow shifts from gold to red. The creature grows larger because it's feeding now — absorbing vibration from everything around it. Grass. Soil. Air. Other creatures.

The Eaters are Singers that went silent and survived anyway. They are what happens when resonance turns to hunger.

**How they hunt:** They don't roar. They don't screech. They create silence. When an Eater gets close, sound dies around it — a radius of nothing. Dallas's equipment flatlines. Birds stop mid-call. Wind seems to stop. The silence is the danger. For a bioacoustics researcher, this is existential horror — the world going mute.

They hunt by surrounding a Singer and collapsing the acoustic space around it. The Singer can't hum, can't call for help, can't sustain its glow. Alone and silent, the Singer's frequency is absorbed by the Eater. The Eater grows. The Singer fades.

**The red eyes:** Not eyes. Inverted resonance chambers — the sealed-over back-holes, now glowing red from the compressed energy inside. They pulse because the stolen frequencies are unstable. The Eaters are in pain. They're always in pain. They eat sound to survive but they can never produce it again. They remember what harmony felt like. That's what makes them vicious.

**Why they circle but don't always attack:** They're afraid of the chord. A group of Singers humming in harmony creates a frequency wall the Eaters can't penetrate. The golden light isn't just pretty — it's a weapon. It pushes the Eaters back. But a lone Singer, or a weakened group, is vulnerable. The Eaters wait for the chord to break.

**Why they won't cross the tree line (yet):** The marsh grass amplifies the Singers' frequency. Open ground doesn't. Outside the grass, the Singers' hum dissipates and the Eaters have no frequency to feed on. The open yard is acoustically dead space — nothing to hunt, nothing to eat. But the storm is changing that.

---

## The Storm — Why Now

**The Nor'easter is an acoustic event.**

A major coastal storm changes barometric pressure dramatically. Pressure changes affect how sound travels — low pressure allows low frequencies to travel farther, penetrate deeper, resonate longer. The approaching Nor'easter is literally lowering the acoustic floor of Branford.

What this means:

- **The Singers' hum can now be heard outside the marsh.** Dallas hears it from his house because the storm is carrying frequencies that normally stay trapped in the grass. His equipment spikes because signals that have been inaudible for centuries are suddenly bleeding through.
- **The Eaters can now feed outside the grass.** The storm is expanding the acoustic range of the marsh. The tree line isn't a hard border anymore. Sound carries further, which means the Eaters' silence-radius extends further. The burn marks on Janice's van, on the side of the house — those are spots where an Eater lingered long enough to drain the residual vibration from the metal and wood. Scorch marks from silence.
- **The crystals are activating.** The pressure change is vibrating crystals that have been dormant for years. Makayla's crystal glows because the storm woke it up. All across the marsh, old waypoints are lighting up — which is why the creatures are surfacing. They're following the crystal network, which is suddenly louder than it's been in a long time.
- **Mr. Mike has been through this before.** He remembers the last big storm — maybe 40, 50 years ago. He heard the hum then. He saw something. Nobody believed him. The numbers he scratches — 115.3 MHz — that's the frequency he heard. He's been carrying it in his body ever since. The dementia isn't just age — the residual frequency has been degrading his cognition for decades. He's not muttering nonsense. He's tuned to a channel nobody else can hear.

**After the storm passes:** The pressure normalizes. The frequencies retreat back into the marsh. The Eaters lose range. The tree line becomes a border again. The town goes back to normal. Pat Clendenen calls it a miracle. But the marsh is still humming. It always was. The only thing that changed is that Dallas can hear it now.

## Dallas's Wife — The Research

She studied infrasound — sound below the threshold of human hearing (below ~20 Hz). Her thesis, never finished, was about "the Hum" — a real phenomenon where people in certain locations report hearing a persistent low-frequency drone that no one can identify or locate. Windsor Hum. Taos Hum. Bristol Hum. She believed the Hum wasn't mechanical or geological. She believed it was biological — something alive, somewhere, producing a frequency that human ears could almost but not quite detect.

She was right.

She never found the source. She died before she could. Dallas carries her equipment — the same Oscillio device, the same scope — not because it's the best gear, but because it's hers. When the creature's back-hole frequency syncs perfectly with his readings, he's not just witnessing a scientific discovery. He's completing her work. The creature is the answer to the question his wife spent her life asking.

The tape he plays at night — her voice talking about the Hum, about why she had to stop researching — she stopped because she was getting sick. The frequency was affecting her. She didn't know it. Dallas might suspect it but can't face it. The Hum didn't kill her directly, but it pulled her toward something her body couldn't sustain. That's why Dallas puts the equipment in the trash. He's not just done with the creatures. He's afraid of becoming her.

He takes it back out because he's more afraid of not listening.

## How The Creatures Change You

*"Every time someone crosses into the tall grass, they come back different."*

The Singers' frequency doesn't just make sound — it resonates with the human nervous system. Prolonged exposure recalibrates how a person perceives the world. This isn't magic. It's acoustic interference with biology. The changes are subtle, cumulative, and permanent.

### Dallas

- **Before the grass:** A man running from silence. He moved to Branford to escape the quiet of a house without Elena. He records sound because silence reminds him of death.
- **After the first trip (Act I):** Unsettled but curious. His equipment picked up something that shouldn't exist. He starts listening differently — not recording for work, but listening for the hum specifically. He catches himself holding his breath to hear better. He didn't do that before.
- **After the second trip (Act II):** Changed at a cellular level. When he touched the creature and their frequencies synced, something in his inner ear shifted. He can now hear a faint undertone in everyday sounds — a harmonic beneath the wind, beneath voices, beneath Howie's bark. He doesn't tell anyone. He thinks he might be losing his mind. He isn't. He's gaining a sense.
- **After the third trip (Act III):** He heard the full chord. The Singers' harmony restructured something in his auditory cortex. He can now distinguish individual frequencies in ambient sound the way a musician hears individual instruments in an orchestra. This is permanent. This is what Elena was approaching before she got sick. The difference: Dallas was exposed to the chord, not a solo frequency. The chord is sustainable. A solo frequency is corrosive. Elena was listening to one voice. Dallas heard the chorus.
- **Act IV:** He builds the alphabet because he can. His ears are different now. He's not decoding — he's translating something he can already hear. The dial clicks into place because he's finally tuned to 115.3 MHz — the frequency his ears have been approaching since the first trip.

### Makayla

- **Before the grass:** Fearless, curious, unfiltered. No grief, no baggage, clean signal.
- **After touching the crystal:** Her hair standing up isn't just static — the crystal's frequency is testing her resonance. She passes. Her body doesn't resist the frequency; it harmonizes with it. This is why the creature's glow brightens at her touch. She's a natural conductor.
- **After each trip:** Makayla doesn't change the way Dallas does. She doesn't need recalibration — she was already open. What changes is her purpose. She goes from curious to protective to active. By Act III she's not following Dallas — she's leading. She sprints into the grass because she can feel the creature dying. Not hear it. Feel it. The frequency is in her bones.
- **Act IV — the caterpillar:** She puts it in a jar not because she's collecting bugs. She's listening to it. She's checking if it hums. She'll spend the rest of her life doing this — testing the world for hidden frequencies. She's the next generation of whatever Dallas and Elena were.

### Dominic

- **Before the grass:** A man who fills silence with activity — cooking, driving, talking, organizing. He can't sit still because stillness is where grief lives.
- **After the events:** Dominic never goes deep into the grass willingly. He chases Makayla in, but he doesn't want to be there. The frequency affects him differently — it doesn't open him up, it confronts him. In the paralysis moment, when the elder Singers freeze him, Dominic hears something in the chord that sounds like his wife's voice. Just for a second. He never tells anyone.
- **Act IV:** He sits next to Dallas at the church lunch and doesn't talk. This is new. Dominic always talks. The silence between them isn't empty anymore — it's full. He's learning that silence isn't the same as absence. The creatures taught him that without either of them knowing it.

### Mr. Mike

- **He's been changed for decades.** The exposure from 40-50 years ago never wore off. His "dementia" is partly acoustic damage — the solo frequency (no chord, no harmony) degraded his neural pathways the way Elena's research degraded her health. He's been hearing 115.3 MHz every day for half a century. It wore grooves in his mind.
- **But he's also the most attuned.** He knows when the Eaters are near before anyone else. He can feel pressure changes that correspond to creature activity. His scratching of numbers and coordinates isn't random — it's data. He's been mapping the creatures' movements for years in a language nobody recognized as a language.
- **The tragedy of Mr. Mike:** He heard the Singers once, alone, without the chord. One voice. It was beautiful and it broke him slowly. If he'd heard the full chorus — if someone had been there to help him find the chord — he'd be fine. He's what Dallas could become if Dallas listens alone.

### Asher

- **Before:** Quiet. Watchful. The kid who notices things but doesn't speak up.
- **After:** He draws. Constantly. He saw the creatures and now his hands won't stop. He doesn't talk about what he saw — he processes it visually. His sketches are increasingly accurate, increasingly detailed. He's not remembering — he's receiving. The frequency left an imprint and it's expressing itself through his hands.
- **The difference between Asher and Makayla:** Makayla channels the frequency outward (action, instinct, running into the grass). Asher channels it inward (observation, art, stillness). Two siblings, same exposure, different instruments.

### Howie

- **Dogs hear 40-60 kHz.** Howie has always heard the Singers. He's lived his whole life next to the marsh hearing a frequency no human around him could detect. His anxiety isn't personality — it's overstimulation. He's been hearing a chorus that nobody else acknowledges.
- **When the Eaters approach:** Howie goes still. Not scared-still. Listening-still. The silence of the Eaters is the first quiet Howie has experienced near the marsh. It's relief and terror at the same time — the noise stops, but something worse fills the gap.
- **Howie and Dallas at the end:** When Dallas tunes the dial and it clicks, Howie's ears perk up. For the first time, a human next to him is hearing what he hears. Howie looks at Dallas. Dallas looks at Howie. They're finally on the same frequency. That's the real ending.

## The Rules of the World

These are the physics of your film. Don't break them.

1. **Sound is alive.** Frequency isn't just measurement — it's the medium through which these creatures exist, communicate, and die.
2. **Silence is death.** For the Singers, going quiet means dying. For the Eaters, silence is a weapon. For Dallas, silence is grief. For Dominic, silence is what he's been running from.
3. **The chord protects.** A Singer alone is vulnerable. Singers together are safe. This is the fundamental rule — isolation kills, connection saves. This maps directly to the human characters.
4. **The crystals are memory.** Every crystal is a recording of a creature's presence. They're the creatures' version of photographs, gravestones, love letters.
5. **The storm is a door, not a cause.** The creatures were always here. The storm just made them audible. The door will close when the pressure normalizes. But Dallas has been changed — he can hear them even after the door closes. He IS the door now.
6. **Exposure changes you permanently.** Once you've heard the chord, your auditory system is recalibrated. You can't unhear it. This is a gift and a curse depending on whether you heard the chord (sustainable) or a solo voice (corrosive).
7. **The Eaters were once Singers.** Every predator was once prey. Every red eye was once gold. This should inform how you shoot them — not as monsters, but as tragedies.
8. **Humans can participate in the chord.** The hymn at life group amplifies the Singers' frequency. This isn't coincidence — collective human singing and the Singers' chorus operate on the same principle. Harmony is harmony regardless of species. The life group doesn't know they're helping the creatures survive. But they are.

## Things That Should Be True But Never Said Out Loud

1. Elena chose Branford on the map because she detected a frequency anomaly in old maritime radio logs from Long Island Sound. She was planning to investigate before she got sick. Dallas doesn't know this — he thinks she circled it randomly.

2. Mr. Mike and Elena never met, but they heard the same signal — 40 years apart, on the same frequency. 115.3 MHz.

3. The Singers have a name for the marsh. It's a chord — three tones played simultaneously. If a human could hear it, it would sound like a lullaby. The creatures have been singing the same song for thousands of years.

4. The Eaters remember the song. They just can't sing it anymore. That's why they circle instead of attacking immediately — they're listening. For a moment, before they feed, they hover at the edge of the chord and remember what they lost.

5. Dallas's dial clicking into place at the end of the film means he's found 115.3 MHz. He's tuned to the frequency Mr. Mike has been carrying for decades, the frequency Elena spent her life chasing. He's the third human to hear it clearly. He won't be the last.

6. The caterpillar Makayla puts in a jar in Act IV isn't just a caterpillar. Watch how it moves. Watch how it hums.

7. The burn marks are shaped like the creatures. If Janice had looked closer at the scorch on her van, she would have seen the outline of a sealed back-hole. She didn't look. She never does.

8. Dominic's wife's name was Grace. The chord the Singers hum when Dominic is near contains a frequency that, if isolated, would sound like someone saying "Grace." It's not intentional. The Singers don't know her name. But sound reflects the listener, and Dominic's grief has a frequency of its own.

## Timeline of the Hum in Branford

| When | What | Who Heard It |
|------|------|-------------|
| Pre-colonial | Mattabeseck people know the marsh hums. They leave it alone. They call it sacred. | The Mattabeseck |
| 1970s | Major Nor'easter. Mr. Mike, then a merchant marine radio operator, picks up 115.3 MHz off the coast. Sees a golden glow moving beneath the water toward the marsh. Never reports it. | Mr. Mike |
| 1970s-2020s | Mr. Mike's cognition slowly degrades. Doctors call it early-onset dementia. He scratches numbers on every surface he can find. Nobody connects the numbers to anything. | Mr. Mike (alone) |
| ~2020 | Elena, an infrasound researcher, detects a frequency anomaly in maritime radio logs from Long Island Sound. Circles Branford on a map. Gets sick before she can investigate. | Elena (indirectly) |
| ~2024 | Elena dies. Dallas carries her equipment and her unfinished questions. | — |
| Present (late summer) | Dallas moves to Branford. Hears the hum on his first night. The Nor'easter approaches, lowering barometric pressure, expanding the acoustic range of the marsh. The Singers surface. The Eaters follow. | Dallas, then everyone |

## A Note on Tone

The creatures are not villains or heroes. The Eaters are not evil — they're starving. The Singers are not innocent — they paralyze humans without consent. This is an ecosystem, not a morality play. Dallas is witnessing a food chain that operates on frequency instead of flesh. His intervention — saving the injured Singer, building the perimeter, entering the grass — is the act of a human inserting himself into a system he doesn't fully understand. The film shouldn't judge whether this is right or wrong. It should show what it costs.

The scariest thing in this film is not a creature. It's the possibility that listening — really listening — changes you in ways you can't reverse. Elena listened and it killed her. Mr. Mike listened and it broke his mind. Dallas listens and it gives him a new language. Same frequency. Different outcomes. The difference is the chord. You can survive the chorus. You can't survive singing alone.

That's the whole movie.
