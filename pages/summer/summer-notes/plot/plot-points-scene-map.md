# Plot points → Scene map (reference)

This document maps the **desired 1–14 plot points** onto the current `script-system/scenes/` files and lists **scene-by-scene add/move/cut** notes plus a **checklist** to ensure the structure stays aligned.

## Plot points → current scenes (recommended placement)

- **1. Dallas finds the creature** → **s08** `s08.md`
- **2. Makayla discovers Dallas has it** → **s13** `s13.md` (with **s12** folded into it)
- **3. Lifegroup meeting** → **s19–s21** (`s19.md`, `s20.md`, `s21.md`)
- **4. Creature escapes** → **s23** `s23.md` (seed Red Eyes in **s22**)
- **5. Creature dies in marsh** → **cold open at start of s24** `s24.md` (before the “we go in” decision)
- **6. Makayla + Dallas go to find it** → **rest of s24** `s24.md`
- **7. First confrontation w/ Dark creatures + weird marks** → **s25** `s25.md`
- **8. Crew retreats; Dominic worries they’ll come** → **top of s26** `s26.md`
- **9. Shadows at edge + Mr Mike/Asher “zap episodes”** → **mid s26** `s26.md`
- **10. Makayla + Dallas hatch the plan** → **end of s26** `s26.md`
- **11. Makayla + Dallas set out with the plan** → **rewrite s27** `s27.md` (remove “impulsive bolt”; make it deliberate)
- **12. Conflict (Light vs Shadow) — climax** → **s28** `s28.md`
- **13. Resolution (unexpected); loss opens path** → **s28 → s29 payoff**
- **14. Aftermath; town back to normal** → **s29** `s29.md`

## Scene-by-scene notes (add / move / cut)

### s05 `s05.md`
- **Cut or consolidate**: this file is already flagged as a merge stub. Keep only the Merlin-app + “movement underneath” beat and paste into `s03.md` if you still want it.

### s08 `s08.md` (Plot point 1)
- **Keep**: trailcam rig, waveform “ladder,” golden flicker, “one injured remains.”
- **Add**: stronger danger/urgency by borrowing the “wake in the reeds / sprint out” energy from `s17.md` (Dallas barely gets out with it).
- **Tighten**: this scene repeats itself (two versions of similar beats). Reduce to one clean escalation.

### s09 `s09.md`
- **Cut**: kitchen triage portion (it’s already called out as duplicate and repeats later).
- **Keep**: Dominic catching Dallas outside + Dallas analyzing the recordings/coordinates (good glue into Makayla/Asher’s “numbers” world).

### s10 `s10.md`
- **Option A (recommended)**: keep it as foreshadow (hum + brief blackout) but **don’t** make it feel like Plot Point 9 yet.
- **Option B**: move this later nearer `s27` if you want the “edge reach” to only happen once.

### s12 `s12.md` + s13 `s13.md` (Plot point 2)
- **Fold**: move s12’s “we want to see what you have” confrontation into the opening of s13.
- **Result**: s13 becomes the definitive “Makayla discovers it + burn-mark crystal + documentation” scene.

### s15 `s15.md`
- **Merge or repurpose**:
  - If you move its chase/escape energy into `s08`, you can **repurpose s15** into “Makayla + Dallas agree to return it (after lifegroup)” + “something is already sniffing around the house,” **or**
  - **Delete s15** once merged if it becomes redundant.

### s17 `s17.md`
- **Keep**: creature-grid draw idea; Makayla calling out “it’s pulling power” is useful for stakes.
- **Add**: one clear line that the creature functions like a *beacon* (keeping it = inviting danger), so Plot Point 4 (escape) doesn’t feel random.

### s19–s21 (Plot point 3: lifegroup)
- **s19**: good surface-normality (people arrive, house fills).
- **s20**: the hidden-crew huddle + “first family arrives” tension is the right engine.
- **s21**: the hymn + rising hum is a strong public collision of “faith/normal” with “signal/unknown.”
- **Cut**: repeating “it’s just storm” rationalizations after you’ve landed it once.

### s22 `s22.md`
- **Keep**: Makayla discovering Sierra’s folder (big “legacy/science” pillar that powers Plot Points 10–13).
- **Change ending**: land an explicit decision (“we return it now / first light”) but they’re too late.

### s23 `s23.md` (Plot point 4)
- **Keep**: this beat is structurally important (even if the file has comments suggesting deletion).
- **Make it causal**: escape is triggered (red-eyes calling, brownout pulse, crystal pull), not random.
- **Plant marks motif**: first clear “weird burn-mark glyphs” evidence can appear along its escape path.

### s24 `s24.md` (Plot points 5–6)
- **Add cold open (Plot point 5)**: before “Mr Mike barges in,” show the creature’s glow failing in the marsh and the predators closing in; *the creature dies/goes out*.
- **Then**: the existing “Dallas/Makayla decide to go” remains Plot Point 6.

### s25 `s25.md` (Plot point 7)
- **Add**: explicit “weird marks” visual to the Red-Eyes (ties to driveway/minivan burn patterns; becomes a recognizable signature).

### s26 `s26.md` (Plot points 8–10)
- **Plot point 8**: after retreat, give Dominic one blunt dread line (“They saw us / now they’ll come”).
- **Plot point 9**: shadows reach the yard edge → trigger “zap episodes”:
  - **Asher**: gets hit when he touches equipment/wire/dial; hair lifts, lock-up, quick blackout.
  - **Mr Mike**: mirrors it (seizure-like lock, rhythm/115.3 chant intensifies).
- **Plot point 10**: make the plan explicit in dialogue and purpose: phase-cancellation corridor / acoustic corridor / “why it works” (Sierra diagram + Makayla’s secondary wave insight).

### s27 `s27.md` (Plot point 11)
- **Replace**: the current “Makayla bolts impulsively” beat.
- **Make deliberate**: Makayla + Dallas set out with the plan (walkies, oscillator, crystal as lure/bait if needed, trap powered). Dominic can still follow—but it’s not accidental.

### s28 `s28.md` (Plot points 12–13)
- **Keep**: Makayla’s “graduation” (mastering the tool / recording the waveform) as the unexpected resolution engine.
- **Make the ‘loss opens path’ concrete**: creature gone but the recording/crystal/corridor logic becomes the new “key” that works in its absence.
- **Avoid**: Dallas “throws equipment away” (this undercuts the legacy/science continuation).

### s29 `s29.md` (Plot point 14)
- **Already aligned**: town normalizes; Pat news beat; Makayla/Asher continuing science; Dallas still recording.

## Alignment checklist (quick validation)

- [ ] **1** Dallas finds the creature on-screen and danger is immediate (not just “he picked it up”).
- [ ] **2** Makayla’s discovery creates a new problem (shared secret + consequences).
- [ ] **3** Lifegroup = public normality colliding with the hum; ends with a decision to return it.
- [ ] **4** Escape is causal/unavoidable (not random) and changes the rules.
- [ ] **5** Creature death is felt and matters mechanically later.
- [ ] **6** Makayla + Dallas choose to go (active choice with clear stakes).
- [ ] **7** First dark-creature confrontation includes distinctive weird marks (recognizable later).
- [ ] **8** Retreat includes explicit dread: “they’ll come for us” (Dominic voice).
- [ ] **9** Shadows at the edge triggers Mr Mike + Asher “zap episodes” (proves it’s not weather).
- [ ] **10** Plan is spoken plainly: what it is, why it works, what could fail.
- [ ] **11** They set out with the plan (not an accident) and the plan gets pressure-tested.
- [ ] **12** Climax has clear swings (who’s winning/losing) with light vs shadow logic.
- [ ] **13** Resolution is unexpected and tied to earlier setups (Sierra folder, grid draw, crystal, corridor).
- [ ] **14** Aftermath restores normalcy while showing legacy/science continues.
