This is a great instinct. Bringing the characters back to "town" (the church, the boardwalk, the news van spots) makes the world feel alive and prevents "house fatigue." It also makes the grass feel like a character that is slowly eating the town.

Here is your Screenplay Roadmap and Checklist in Markdown format.

🗺️ Location Map: The Three Rings
Use this to visualize where your characters are. The further they go from the center, the more dangerous it gets.

Location	Ring	Purpose in the Movie
The Kitchen/Basement	
Ring 1: Safe Zone	
Domesticity, the "secret," surrogate family bonding.

The Driveway/Porch	
Ring 2: Threshold	
Interaction with "Normal" Branford (Dominic, News Vans).

The Church/Picnic Area	
Ring 2: Threshold	
Community pressure; Dallas trying to "act normal."

The Boardwalk	
Ring 3: The Wild	
Observation. Where they see the birds and the "hum."

The Deep Grass/Hollow	
Ring 3: The Wild	
Survival, Predators, and the Supernatural.

🎭 The "B" Stories (Character Wants)
Traditional films give characters a goal that has nothing to do with the monster. This is what makes them feel human.

Dallas (The Anchor): * Want: To preserve Sierra’s voice and image.

Need: To let go of the "echoes" to save the living (Makayla and the creature).

Makayla (The Bridge): * Want: To prove she’s a real scientist/artist like Sierra.

Need: To realize she doesn’t need Sierra’s notes to understand the world.

Dominic (The Town): * Want: A quiet, safe community.

Need: To acknowledge that "evil" (the Red-Eyes) exists even in a small town.

✅ Post-Work To-Do Checklist
When you sit back down to write, follow these steps to tighten Act II:

📍 Phase 1: Environmental Layering
[ ] Scene 6 Update: Add the Channel 8 News Van idling at the end of Dallas’s driveway. Have the reporter, Pat, doing a "stand-up" shot while Dallas tries to sneak a box of supplies into his house.

[ ] Scene 12 Update: Instead of just finding a burn mark, have Dallas find it while he's trying to get the mail. The "normal" chore makes the "weird" mark stand out more.

📍 Phase 2: The "Porch" Fix (Productive Dialogue)
[ ] Rewrite Scene 13: Keep them OUT of the grass.

[ ] Place Dallas and Makayla on the Front Porch.

[ ] Have them fixing the military oscillator. Use this time to have Makayla ask about Sierra's field notes. This builds their "Normal Life" bond without stopping the plot.

📍 Phase 3: The "Vertical" Move
[ ] Transition Scene: Before the Life Group arrives, write a quick beat where Dallas and Asher move the creature to the Basement.

[ ] Scene 19-21 Update: Change the location of the Life Group meeting to the Living Room (above the basement).

[ ] The Ripple Effect: Describe the tea/coffee rippling in the cups when the creature hums from below. This is much more cinematic than it just being in the kitchen.

📍 Phase 4: The "Town" Check-In
[ ] Scene 22 Idea: Have Makayla go to the Church/Library to cross-reference Sierra's "Red-Eyes" notes with town archives. This gets a character out of the house and shows more of Branford.

💡 Pacing Tip: The "Rule of Three"
To stay on track, remember this sequence for Act II:

The Secret Grows: It's in the kitchen (Private).

The Secret is Threatened: The Life Group is upstairs (Public vs. Private).

The Secret Escapes: The creature goes missing (The stakes move back to the Grass).
