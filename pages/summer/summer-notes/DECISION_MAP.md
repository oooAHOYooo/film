# Decision Map — Additions & Proposed Deletions

Use this alongside the compiled script. Every tagged `[ADDITION]` and every proposed `[DELETION]` is listed below with the exact text and a short rationale.

Mark each row ✅ (keep), ❌ (cut), or ✏️ (rewrite) as you go.

---

## How to read this

- **ADDITION** = text already in the scene files, wrapped in `<!-- [ADDITION] -->` tags.
- **DELETION** = text currently in the scene files (no tags yet) that the review suggests removing or merging elsewhere.

---

## SCENE 02 — Dallas Night (`02_dallas-night.md`)

### ADDITION: Sierra folder seed
**Lines 11–13**
```
One of the folders slips open as he lifts it—inside, a glimpse of hand-drawn sketches
and a tab labeled "FIELD NOTES — BRANFORD 1978." Dallas closes it without looking
and sets the stack aside.
```
**Purpose:** Plants the discovery Makayla makes in Scene 22.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 03 — The Hum (`03_the-hum.md`)

### ADDITION: First grid instability hint
**Lines 84–86**
```
The streetlight above them flickers. Once. Twice. Then steadies. Dallas watches it
for a beat, then looks back at the birds.
```
**Purpose:** First visual seed of the acoustic parasite / grid drain.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 04 — Marsh Walk (`04_marsh_walk.md`)

### DELETION (STRUCTURAL): Entire scene — merge into Scene 03
**Rationale:** This is a second marsh walk that hits the same beats as Scene 03 (coastal trail, tall grass, Dallas secretly recording, Dominic commenting). The REVIEW says "Combine the first two marsh walks." The Merlin app detail and the "something moving underneath" beat (lines 13–16, 34–36) can be folded into the end of Scene 03 as a few lines.
**What to salvage:**
```
See this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species.
```
```
Dallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks
like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.
```
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 05 — News Vans (`05_news_vans.md`)

### ADDITION: Pat names brownouts
**Lines 12–14**
```
We're also getting reports of rolling brownouts along the Route 146 corridor—UI says
it's weather-related surges, but they're sending a crew to check the Branford substation.
```
**Purpose:** Sets up Makayla's substation line in Scene 18.
**Decision:** [ ]

### ADDITION: Burn marks + cycling streetlight at Dominic's driveway
**Lines 36–38**
```
Above him, the streetlight at the end of the driveway cycles—on, off, on—in a slow,
deliberate rhythm that doesn't match the others on the block.
```
**Purpose:** Links burn marks to grid instability visually.
**Decision:** [ ]

### DELETION (THINNING): Remove the driveway streetlight addition
**Rationale:** Pat's brownout report already carries the grid-instability seed for this scene. The driveway streetlight is a second grid beat in the same scene — redundant. Save visual grid proof for Scenes 10/11 where the full blackout escalates.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 06 — The Coordinates (`06_the_coordinates.md`)

### ADDITION: Makayla connects hum to grid
**Line 106 (inline)**
```
And the streetlights on our block were doing that thing again—cycling on and off.
Every time I hear the sound, the lights go weird.
```
**Purpose:** Makayla is already observing the grid pattern.
**Decision:** [ ]

### DELETION (THINNING): Remove Makayla's grid observation
**Rationale:** She hasn't earned this insight yet. At this point in the story she's just a curious kid who wants to borrow an oscillator. Her expertise should emerge gradually — save her grid knowledge for Scene 18 where she identifies the secondary wave on the oscilloscope. Removing it here makes her growth arc cleaner.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 07 — Dallas Marsh Walk (`07_dallas_marsh_walk.md`)

### DELETION (STRUCTURAL): Remove the creature encounter (lines 30–39)
**Current text:**
```
There he sees a faint glow - as he approaches he notices that there is a group of
biolumniset creatures huddling around the gnarl of an old tree.

Dallas in a daze follows it.

The creature is biolumenist - much like a firefly - the other creatures scatter into
the marsh as if they were little orbs of golden light - but remains is one, smaller
than the rest, injured and letting a cry out.

As Dallas approaches the other creatures scatter away...

Dallas takes the creature in his hand and slowly walks away fast...
```
**Rationale:** Dallas finds the creature *twice* — here and again in Scenes 13–15. The outline treats 13–15 as the real discovery sequence. This scene should end with Dallas seeing the golden light but NOT reaching it. The "almost but not yet" builds anticipation. Let him hear the silence, see the glow, and retreat unsettled — save the actual rescue for Scenes 13–15.
**What to keep:**
```
From the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh.
Dallas notices it—but it's gone.
```
End the scene there (or with Dallas retreating, disturbed, without the creature).
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 08 — Dallas Home Night (`08_dallas_home_night.md`)

### ADDITION: Second Sierra folder tease
**Lines 60–62**
```
His elbow brushes the stack of Sierra's folders. One slides open—a corner of a sketch
visible. Something with wings. He pushes it closed without looking. Not yet.
```
**Purpose:** Keeps Sierra's research in peripheral vision.
**Decision:** [ ]

### DELETION (REDUNDANCY): Remove kitchen creature examination (lines 1–14)
**Current text (INT. DALLAS KITCHEN section):**
```
As it cries out - Dallas' equipment begins to pulse and spike.

Dallas is alone and it is getting dark. He dashes back home with the creature...
He puts it on a gentle pan with parchment paper - and begins to look through big
jewerly glasses - as to see what is wrong with it.

The creature is asleep and Dallas notices that it has blood marks underneath its top wing.

Dallas treats the wound and then gently brings it outside. But as he does - he notices
that the creature communicates somehow with the oscillators in the kitchen.
```
**Rationale:** This kitchen triage repeats in Scenes 17 and 18 (makeshift hospital / entering grass) with much more detail and dramatic context. If you delete the creature from Scene 07, this triage automatically goes too. Keep Scene 08 focused on: Dominic picking up Howie, the late-night recording session, the grid coordinates matching Mr. Mike's scratches. That's the scene's real engine.
**Decision:** [ ]

### DELETION (REDUNDANCY): Remove kitchen creature check at end (lines 66–68)
**Current text:**
```
INT. DALLAS KITCHEN
Dallas looks at the creature - who is appearing to be drinking water and eating the
grass - but is still sleeping inside of a gnarl of the aquarium Dallas has obviously
made for it.
```
**Rationale:** Same issue — creature husbandry detail that belongs in Scene 17/18, not here.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 10 — Shadows in Wind (`10_shadows_in_wind.md`)

### ADDITION: Full neighborhood blackout synced with HUM
**Lines 25–27**
```
Behind him, the streetlights along the block go dark—all of them, at once. Three
seconds of blackout. Then they snap back on, one by one, from the marsh outward,
as if the power is being returned in sequence.
```
**Purpose:** Major escalation of grid drain — full blackout, not just a flicker.
**Decision:** [ ]

### DELETION (STRUCTURAL): Merge entire scene into Scene 11
**Rationale:** Scene 10 (Dallas walks Howie, reader spikes, coyotes, storm alert, hum, Howie afraid) and Scene 11 (Dallas at window, shadows, hum, Dominic collects Howie, life group Thursday) are the same dramatic beat: "Dallas near the marsh at twilight, gets spooked." Merge Scene 10's reader-spike / coyote / blackout material into the opening of Scene 11 so there's one escalating scene instead of two quiet ones.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 11 — Howie Walk (`11_howie_walk.md`)

### ADDITION: Interior light drain
**Lines 9–11**
```
The overhead light dims—not a flicker, but a slow, steady drain, as if something is
pulling the current out of the walls. Then it returns to full brightness.
```
**Purpose:** The creature is pulling current from the house.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 13 — Entering Grass (`13_entering_grass.md`)

### ADDITION: Makayla documents like a scientist
**Lines 37–39**
```
She pulls out her phone and starts recording video. Then stops. She puts the phone
away and instead grabs a notebook from her back pocket... She begins to sketch the
creature. Careful, precise lines. The back-holes. The ears. The glow. She is
documenting it the way a scientist would, not the way a teenager would.
```
**Purpose:** Establishes her legacy motivation early.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 15 + 16 — The Burn Mark / The Escape

### DELETION (STRUCTURAL): Delete Scene 16 entirely
**Rationale:** Scene 16 (`16_the_escape.md`) is nearly line-for-line identical to the opening of Scene 13 (`13_entering_grass.md`):
- Both open with "EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - DAWN"
- Both have Janice dropping Howie off from the minivan
- Both have Makayla and Asher finding a burn mark and crystal
- Both have Makayla kneeling, static electricity, pocketing the crystal

Scene 16 adds Dominic's Costco trip and schools-cancelled info — fold those two lines into Scene 15 or Scene 13's porch section. Delete Scene 16 as a file.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 18 — Entering Grass / Triage (`18_entering_grass.md`)

### ADDITION: Makayla identifies secondary wave / grid draw
**Lines 29–46**
```
MAKAYLA
Wait. Look at that.

Behind the creature's smooth sine wave, a second signal appears—jagged, arrhythmic...

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
That's not coming from the creature. That's a draw. It's pulling power.

...The substation on Route 146 is already hum-cycling...
```
**Purpose:** Makayla connects creature frequency to town infrastructure — raises stakes beyond the backyard.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 19 — Life Group Arrives (`19_life_group_arrives.md`)

### ADDITION: Grid pulse + Dominic names brownouts
**Lines 7–15**
```
The kitchen light dims and surges—a slow, visible pulse, as if the house is breathing
with the creature.

DOMINIC
(from the doorway, carrying boxes)
Third brownout this week. UI says it's the storm. I don't think it's the storm.

Dallas adjusts the dial again. The creature quiets. The lights stabilize.
```
**Purpose:** Dominic names the pattern. Links creature activity to power.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 21 — The Hymn (`21_the_hymn.md`)

### ADDITION: Lights dim in rhythm + Sarah's tea ripples
**Lines 48–50**
```
The overhead lights dim in time with the creature's harmonics—a slow pulse that
matches the rhythm of the hymn. Sarah's tea ripples in her cup, concentric rings
expanding outward in perfect time.
```
**Purpose:** Visual proof of acoustic parasite for the audience — the creature's song is physically disrupting the room.
**Decision:** [ ]

### ADDITION: "The lights pulse lower and lower" (line 54, inline)
**Purpose:** Escalation within the hymn scene.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 22 — Red Eyes (`22_red_eyes.md`)

### ADDITION: Makayla discovers Sierra's folder
**Lines 15–37**
```
INT. DALLAS'S STUDY - SAME TIME

Makayla sits cross-legged on the floor... A label on the box reads "SIERRA."
She opens a manila folder and stops. Inside: hand-drawn sketches—anatomical, careful.
Golden creatures with back-holes and translucent ears. Dated 1978...

MAKAYLA
They've been here since the seventies. Hiding in the noise.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
If the Red-Eyes take them out tonight, this folder is just a collection of ghost
stories. I'm not letting them become a myth again.
```
**Purpose:** Scientific legacy pillar. Makayla's "why."
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 23 — Creature Missing (`23_creature_missing.md`)

### ADDITION: Dallas finally opens Sierra's folder
**Lines 7–9**
```
As the tape plays, Dallas's hand drifts to the stack of Sierra's folders... He's seen
them before but never looked. He looks now. He closes the folder and sets it on top
of the box—visible, accessible.
```
**Purpose:** Dallas leaves the folder where Makayla will find it.
**Decision:** [ ]

### DELETION (STRUCTURAL): Delete entire scene
**Rationale:** The REVIEW explicitly says (line 65): *"DELETE the 'Creature goes missing' beat. It slows down the momentum."* The creature passively wandering off deflates the Red-Eye threat. Instead, go directly from Scene 22 (Red Eyes watching the house) to Scene 24 (creature abducted, burn marks on Janice's van). The Red-Eyes should *take* the creature — not have it wander away on its own.

**What to salvage — relocate to Scene 22:**
- Dallas listening to Sierra's tape and opening the folder (move to Scene 22, after the "red eyes" trance)
- The wife's voice / "the great hum — something she read about as a girl" (powerful — belongs in Scene 22's solitude)

**What to cut entirely:**
- "The creature is gone" passive discovery
- The video monitor check
- The "eyes gone, night still" deflation
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 24 — Marsh Confrontation (`24_marsh_confrontation.md`)

### ADDITION: Asher connects burn marks to dead streetlight
**Lines 11–23**
```
The streetlight at the end of the driveway is dead—not flickering, just dark...

ASHER
Mom. Look.

He points at the streetlight, then at the burn trail. The pattern is the same.

ASHER
The lights are doing it too.
```
**Purpose:** Asher sees the grid pattern.
**Decision:** [ ]

### DELETION (THINNING): Simplify or remove Asher's grid observation
**Rationale:** By Scene 24, the audience has seen the grid connection in Scenes 03, 10/11, 18, and 19. Asher confirming it again adds a character beat but no new information. If you keep it, trim to just the dead streetlight visual — cut the dialogue. The image is enough.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 25 — Predator Attack (`25_predator_attack.md`)

### ADDITION: Makayla cross-references Sierra's folder + Commander moment
**Lines 19–54**
```
Makayla... picks up the second receiver and starts scanning frequencies alongside him...
She pulls out Sierra's folder and cross-references a frequency notation with what's
on screen. A match.

...

MAKAYLA
If that creature's frequency hits the transformer on the street while it's being
attacked, the feedback loop will fry the whole grid. We aren't just rescuing a pet,
Dominic. We're keeping the lights on for the whole neighborhood.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
We have to go get it back.
```
**Purpose:** Makayla's "Commander" moment — transforms her from witness to leader. Raises stakes to town-wide.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 26 — The Perimeter (`26_the_perimeter.md`)

### ADDITION: Makayla witnesses extinction
**Lines 11–15**
```
MAKAYLA
(whispering, barely audible)
They're erasing the frequency. If there's nothing left to record, no one will ever
know they existed.
```
**Purpose:** Motivates the trap design — she needs to capture proof before it's gone.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 27 — The Last Dinner (`27_the_last_dinner.md`)

### ADDITION: Phase-cancellation trap replaces pole perimeter
**Lines 16–43**
```
Dallas drags his equipment to the edge of the yard—the oscillator, the military
receiver, two speakers he's wired in series...

MAKAYLA
Phase cancellation. If we broadcast the inverse of the Red-Eye frequency through
this channel, anything that crosses through gets stun-locked...

MAKAYLA
A recording. A clean, undeniable frequency capture. Not a ghost story. Not a myth. Proof.
```
**Purpose:** Replaces the generic pole/wire fence with an acoustic trap that uses the tools already established. Gives Makayla agency in the design.
**Decision:** [ ]

### ADDITION: Trap description replaces pole/wire/fence language
**Lines 37–43**
```
The crew stare at the tall grass. The trap is set—not a wall to hide behind, but a
kill zone designed to catch a predator.
```
**Purpose:** Reframes the perimeter as offensive rather than defensive.
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 28 — Final Echoes (`28_final_echoes.md`)

### ADDITION: Trap hums to life (replaces "powers on poles")
**Lines 37–39**
```
Dallas powers on the speakers and the oscillator. The trap hums to life—a low, steady
broadcast aimed at the corridor between the equipment.
```
**Decision:** [ ]

### ADDITION: Trap check replaces "secures the fence"
**Lines 49–51**
```
Dallas checks the trap one last time—the speakers are holding, the sensor blinking
steady between them.
```
**Decision:** [ ]

### ADDITION: Makayla's graduation — bioacoustic hunter climax
**Lines 62–80**
```
In her lap: Dallas's oscillator. She has it wired to the creature's back-holes with
the alligator clips from the kitchen triage. Her fingers move across the dial with
precision...

She is actively broadcasting—matching the creature's output frequency and amplifying
it outward...

Dallas stops. He watches her. This isn't the girl who asked "What does that do?" in
the kitchen. She has mastered the tool he gave her.

...Makayla glances down at the oscillator screen. The waveform is clean. Sharp.
Unmistakable. She hits record.
```
**Purpose:** Replaces original climax. Makayla graduates from curious kid to bioacoustic hunter.
**Decision:** [ ]

### DELETION: "He puts his equipment in the trash" (line 88)
**Current text:**
```
Morning. Dallas is still making calculations. Then he stops. He puts his equipment
in the trash. The crew leaves. Dallas is alone again.
```
**Rationale:** The REVIEW flags this (line 3): *"Dallas putting his equipment in the trash feels like he's giving up on the mystery."* It contradicts every addition — the clean recording, the Sierra legacy, Makayla's mastery. The additions say the work continues; this line says it's over. Delete "He puts his equipment in the trash." Let him simply be alone and then hear the pulse return. The silence speaks louder.
**Suggested replacement:**
```
Morning. Dallas is still making calculations. Then he stops. The crew leaves. Dallas
is alone again.
```
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## SCENE 29 — Aftermath (`29_aftermath.md`)

### ADDITION: Equipment wreckage + clean recording payoff
**Lines 6–14**
```
Dallas looks around at his property—the storm has scattered his equipment. Speakers
knocked face-down in the mud. The oscillator on its side, screen cracked. But the
sensor Makayla wired between them is still blinking... one clean recording.

He presses play. The sound fills the yard—alien, harmonic, unmistakable...

He doesn't need to carry it alone anymore.
```
**Purpose:** The recording survives the storm. Payoff for Makayla's trap. Legacy transfer.
**Decision:** [ ]

### ADDITION: Sierra's folder on the bench
**Lines 29–31**
```
On the bench next to them: Sierra's folder, open. They're cross-referencing her
sketches with their own observations.
```
**Decision:** [ ]

### ADDITION: "The legacy continues—not as ghost stories, but as science." (line 32, inline)
**Decision:** [ ]

---

## Quick-Reference: Deletion Priorities

**High priority (structural — saves the most time and fixes the most repetition):**
1. Delete Scene 16 (duplicate of Scene 13)

5. Remove creature encounter from Scene 07 (Dallas finds creature twice)

**Medium priority (redundancy within scenes):**
6. Remove kitchen triage from Scene 08 (repeats in 17/18)
7. Delete "equipment in trash" from Scene 28

**Low priority (thinning — polish pass):**
8. Remove grid flicker from Scene 05 driveway
9. Remove Makayla's grid line from Scene 06
10. Simplify Asher's grid dialogue in Scene 24
