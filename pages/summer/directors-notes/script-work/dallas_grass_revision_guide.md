# Dallas Grass Revision Guide

This guide is the rewrite map for Dallas's movement in and out of the grass, and how the creature state changes each time.

## Goal (Clear Rewrite Target)

Dallas finds the creature.  
Makayla learns the truth early.  
They hide the creature from the Life Group.  
The creature escapes and is in danger.  
Makayla runs into the grass first.  
Dallas chases her and finds the creature during a battle.  
Dark creatures pursue them.  
Dallas and Makayla use frequency strategy to stop the dark creatures and save the light creatures.

## Transition Count Targets

- Dallas enters grass: **3**
- Dallas leaves grass: **3**
- Dallas enters without creature: **3 of 3**
- Dallas leaves with creature: **2 of 3**
- Dallas leaves without creature: **1 of 3**

## Current vs Target Flow

### Current Full Script (high level)

1. Entry 1: Dallas enters grass without creature (discovery stretch).
2. Exit 1: Dallas exits with creature (rescue stretch).
3. Entry 2: Dallas enters again with Makayla (rescue return).
4. Exit 2: They retreat under pressure, usually without creature certainty.
5. Entry 3: Final night entry after Makayla runs out.
6. Exit 3: Emotional win exists, but movement clarity can still be tighter.

### Target Revision Flow (clean and explicit)

1. **Entry 1 (without creature):** Dallas follows signal and finds injured light creature.
2. **Exit 1 (with creature):** Dallas brings creature home and seals house as temporary safe zone.
3. **House secrecy beat:** Makayla knows; they hide creature from Life Group while hum threat escalates.
4. **Entry 2 (without creature):** Creature escapes; Makayla runs out; Dallas chases.
5. **Exit 2 (with creature):** Dallas and Makayla recover creature during battle while dark predators close in.
6. **Entry 3 (without creature, optional but recommended):** Tactical re-entry to execute frequency trap and protect remaining light creatures.
7. **Exit 3 (without creature, strategic end state):** They exit alive with proof + containment method now working.

## Scene Mapping to Your Current Full Script

- Discovery and first carry home: `creature-rescue`, `the-burn-mark-2`, `the-escape`, `makeshift-hospital`
- Hide from Life Group: `life-group-arrives`, `basement-huddle`, `the-hymn`
- Escape and chase trigger: `creature-missing`, `marsh-confrontation`, `predator-attack`
- Battle and tactical save path: `the-perimeter`, `the-last-dinner`, `final-echoes`

## Rewrite Pass Checklist

- [ ] Every grass sequence starts with an explicit line: `ENTER GRASS - WITH/WITHOUT CREATURE`.
- [ ] Every grass sequence ends with an explicit line: `EXIT GRASS - WITH/WITHOUT CREATURE`.
- [ ] Makayla learns about the creature before Life Group arrives.
- [ ] Hide-from-Life-Group tension is active (hum, house pressure, near-discovery moments).
- [ ] Creature escape trigger is immediate and causal, not a vague disappearance.
- [ ] Makayla runs first; Dallas follows (clear urgency and character agency).
- [ ] Battle section clearly shows what Dallas/Makayla do tactically to save light creatures.
- [ ] Final outcome confirms dark-creature suppression and light-creature survival path.

## Definition of Done for This Revision

- Movement clarity: a reader can count Dallas grass entries/exits without guessing.
- Character clarity: Dallas and Makayla goals are aligned and active.
- Threat clarity: dark creatures are not just visual; they are tactical pressure.
- Resolution clarity: the ending demonstrates a repeatable method to protect light creatures.
