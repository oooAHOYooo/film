# Dallas Grass Revision Guide

# FURTHER - START HERE
from Gemini 2.11.26
Based on the script provided, the plot you outlined matches some parts of the story, but there are several key differences in the sequence and specific details.

Here is a breakdown of what happens in the script versus your list, followed by a checklist of scenes to add or adjust to reach your desired story:

Does this happen in the script?

Dallas finds creature: Yes. In Scene 7, Dallas finds an injured, bioluminescent creature in the marsh and brings it home.
+1


Makayla also finds creature with Dallas: Close. She doesn't find it with him in the marsh, but she discovers it in his kitchen in Scene 11/12.
+1


Lifegroup Creature freak out: Not yet. The script mentions Lifegroup is scheduled for Thursday at Dallas's house, but the provided text ends before the meeting occurs.
+1


Creature Escapes / Creature Dies: Not yet. The creature is currently alive and being treated by Dallas in an aquarium.
+1


Dark Shadow Fight: Not yet. Dallas sees "dark shadows" in the grass, but there has been no physical fight or marking of the characters so far.


Building the Device: In progress. Dallas and Makayla have discussed his oscillator and how it might track the creatures, but they haven't built a new rescue device yet.
+2

Checklist to reach your plot (Scene-by-Scene Additions)
To align the script with your specific vision, you would need to add or modify the following scenes:

[ ] Scene 14: The Lifegroup Discovery

Action: During the church Lifegroup meeting at Dallas’s house, the creature (likely in the aquarium) is discovered by the group.

Result: Chaos ensues as the neighbors/church members react with fear or wonder (the "freak out").

[ ] Scene 15: The Escape and Death

Action: In the panic of the Lifegroup meeting, the creature escapes into the backyard/marsh.

Action: Dallas and Makayla track it, only to find it has succumbed to its injuries or the environment.

[ ] Scene 16: The Shadow Confrontation


Action: While mourning the creature, the "Dark Shadows" (the spindly figures from Scene 10) emerge from the tall grass.

Action: A physical struggle occurs. The shadows leave physical "marks" on Dallas and Makayla (perhaps bioluminescent burns similar to the ones found in the yard ).

[ ] Scene 17: Engineering the Solution


Action: Realizing the shadows are a threat and the creatures are the key, Makayla and Dallas use the "weird stone" she found  and Dallas’s military-grade oscillators to build a specialized communication/rescue device.

[ ] Scene 18: The Second Rescue

Action: They return to the "Hollow" in the tall grass during the peak of the storm.

Action: They activate the device, which successfully calls to the remaining creatures or protects a new one from the shadows.

[ ] Scene 19: The Departure

Action: The device opens a path or frequency that allows all the creatures to leave the marsh safely.


Action: As they leave, the atmospheric pressure changes, causing the predicted "Nor'easter" to dissipate or move out to sea.

[ ] Scene 20: The Aftermath

Action: The "Storm is missed." The neighborhood is safe, and the tall grass returns to being just grass, though Dallas and Makayla still bear the marks of what happened.



This guide is the rewrite map for Dallas's movement in and out of the grass, and how the creature state changes each time.

## Goal (Clear Rewrite Target)

Dallas finds the creature.  
Makayla learns the truth early.  
They hide the creature from the Life Group.  
The creature escapes and is in danger.  
Makayla runs into the grass first.  
Dallas chases her and finds the creature during a battle.  
Dark creatures pursue them.  
Dallas and Makayla use frequency strategy to stop the dark creatures and save the light creatures.

## Transition Count Targets

- Dallas enters grass: **3**
- Dallas leaves grass: **3**
- Dallas enters without creature: **3 of 3**
- Dallas leaves with creature: **2 of 3**
- Dallas leaves without creature: **1 of 3**

## Current vs Target Flow

### Current Full Script (high level)

1. Entry 1: Dallas enters grass without creature (discovery stretch).
2. Exit 1: Dallas exits with creature (rescue stretch).
3. Entry 2: Dallas enters again with Makayla (rescue return).
4. Exit 2: They retreat under pressure, usually without creature certainty.
5. Entry 3: Final night entry after Makayla runs out.
6. Exit 3: Emotional win exists, but movement clarity can still be tighter.

### Target Revision Flow (clean and explicit)

1. **Entry 1 (without creature):** Dallas follows signal and finds injured light creature.
2. **Exit 1 (with creature):** Dallas brings creature home and seals house as temporary safe zone.
3. **House secrecy beat:** Makayla knows; they hide creature from Life Group while hum threat escalates.
4. **Entry 2 (without creature):** Creature escapes; Makayla runs out; Dallas chases.
5. **Exit 2 (with creature):** Dallas and Makayla recover creature during battle while dark predators close in.
6. **Entry 3 (without creature, optional but recommended):** Tactical re-entry to execute frequency trap and protect remaining light creatures.
7. **Exit 3 (without creature, strategic end state):** They exit alive with proof + containment method now working.

## Scene Mapping to Your Current Full Script

- Discovery and first carry home: `creature-rescue`, `the-burn-mark-2`, `the-escape`, `makeshift-hospital`
- Hide from Life Group: `life-group-arrives`, `basement-huddle`, `the-hymn`
- Escape and chase trigger: `creature-missing`, `marsh-confrontation`, `predator-attack`
- Battle and tactical save path: `the-perimeter`, `the-last-dinner`, `final-echoes`

## Rewrite Pass Checklist

- [ ] Every grass sequence starts with an explicit line: `ENTER GRASS - WITH/WITHOUT CREATURE`.
- [ ] Every grass sequence ends with an explicit line: `EXIT GRASS - WITH/WITHOUT CREATURE`.
- [ ] Makayla learns about the creature before Life Group arrives.
- [ ] Hide-from-Life-Group tension is active (hum, house pressure, near-discovery moments).
- [ ] Creature escape trigger is immediate and causal, not a vague disappearance.
- [ ] Makayla runs first; Dallas follows (clear urgency and character agency).
- [ ] Battle section clearly shows what Dallas/Makayla do tactically to save light creatures.
- [ ] Final outcome confirms dark-creature suppression and light-creature survival path.

## Definition of Done for This Revision

- Movement clarity: a reader can count Dallas grass entries/exits without guessing.
- Character clarity: Dallas and Makayla goals are aligned and active.
- Threat clarity: dark creatures are not just visual; they are tactical pressure.
- Resolution clarity: the ending demonstrates a repeatable method to protect light creatures.
