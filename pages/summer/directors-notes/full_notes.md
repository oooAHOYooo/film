# Script Additions

Notes and ideas to add or change in the script. Use this as a running list; you can also add scene-specific additions in each scene’s director note.

---

## General

- **Phase-cancellation trap**: Where we had pole/perimeter language, consider the acoustic corridor (two speakers, opposing frequencies) as the main visual — no wall, just a kill zone. See Scene 27 note.
- **Tone**: Keep the contrast between Pat Clendenen’s “beautiful southern New England morning” and the hum — one line of radio can do a lot.

---

## By scene (quick ref)

- **27 The Last Dinner**: Replaced pole perimeter with phase-cancellation trap; replaced fence/wire language with “trap set, not a wall.”

Add more below as you go.

## Script additions (in script)

- Pole perimeter → **phase-cancellation trap**: acoustic corridor with two speakers, opposing frequencies. Dallas + Makayla set it up; no physical wall, just a kill zone.
- Fence/wire language → “trap set—not a wall to hide behind, but a kill zone designed to catch a predator.”

## Director notes

- **Beat**: “This is crazy. What are we doing here.” — no one answers. Hold the silence; then cut or hold on the grass.
- **Pat Clendenen**: One line of radio (“beautiful southern New England morning”) does the contrast; don’t overdo the news-van callback.
- **Equipment**: Dallas’s oscillator, military receiver, two speakers in series. Makayla’s sensor between the speakers. Keep it tactile — cables, dials, one squeal when Asher reaches for the dial.

## Ideas / maybes

- Fire engines in the distance: how close? Same as news vans or further?
- Sea birds right before the hum — one or two shots, then the sound takes over.


### ACT IV — Aftermath

#### Scene 28: Final Echoes

*ID: final-echoes*

*No director's note for this scene.*

#### Scene 29: Aftermath

*ID: aftermath*

*No director's note for this scene.*

## Other Ideas

# Other Ideas

Miscellaneous director ideas — tone, imagery, casting, design — not tied to a specific scene.

---

- **Sound design**: The hum should feel like it’s *under* the marsh, not in the air. Low end first, then harmonics.
- **Creature design**: Small one = vulnerable, large ones = all shadow and red eyes until the very end. Less is more.
- **Light**: Yellow flicker (small creatures) vs red (predators) in the grass — keep the color language simple.
- **Dallas’s gear**: Military surplus receiver, homemade oscillator, consumer speakers. Nothing sleek.

Add more as they come.

##Makayla's explanation of the way light can carry sound

Makayla goes and has a segment where she is talking how the light used to transmist sound instead of using radar. Does that still happen? A man in nintendo did that - did you know that?

A little test for a recompilin
