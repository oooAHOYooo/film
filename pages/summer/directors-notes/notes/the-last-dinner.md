# Scene: The Last Dinner

## Script additions (in script)

- Pole perimeter → **phase-cancellation trap**: acoustic corridor with two speakers, opposing frequencies. Dallas + Makayla set it up; no physical wall, just a kill zone.
- Fence/wire language → “trap set—not a wall to hide behind, but a kill zone designed to catch a predator.”

## Director notes

- **Beat**: “This is crazy. What are we doing here.” — no one answers. Hold the silence; then cut or hold on the grass.
- **Pat Clendenen**: One line of radio (“beautiful southern New England morning”) does the contrast; don’t overdo the news-van callback.
- **Equipment**: Dallas’s oscillator, military receiver, two speakers in series. Makayla’s sensor between the speakers. Keep it tactile — cables, dials, one squeal when Asher reaches for the dial.

## Ideas / maybes

- Fire engines in the distance: how close? Same as news vans or further?
- Sea birds right before the hum — one or two shots, then the sound takes over.
