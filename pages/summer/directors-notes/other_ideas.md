# Other Ideas

Miscellaneous director ideas — tone, imagery, casting, design — not tied to a specific scene.

---

- **Sound design**: The hum should feel like it’s *under* the marsh, not in the air. Low end first, then harmonics.
- **Creature design**: Small one = vulnerable, large ones = all shadow and red eyes until the very end. Less is more.
- **Light**: Yellow flicker (small creatures) vs red (predators) in the grass — keep the color language simple.
- **Dallas’s gear**: Military surplus receiver, homemade oscillator, consumer speakers. Nothing sleek.

Add more as they come.

## Makayla's explanation of the way light can carry sound

Makayla goes and has a segment where she is talking how the light used to transmist sound instead of using radar. Does that still happen? A man in nintendo did that - did you know that?

A little test for a recompilin

I think I want it so 
1. Dallas finds creature
2. Makayla also finds crature with Dallas
3. Lifegroup Creature freak out
4. Creature Escapes
5. Creature Dies
6. Find Creature 
7. Dark Shadow Fight
8. Dark shadows now mark Makayla and Dallas
9. Makayla and Dallas build device
10. Turn on device
11. Back to Grass - Rescue Creature again - 
12. Creatures leave
13. Storm is missed

### THIS IS WHAT GEMINI SAID ABOUT THAT

from Gemini 2.11.26
Based on the script provided, the plot you outlined matches some parts of the story, but there are several key differences in the sequence and specific details.

Here is a breakdown of what happens in the script versus your list, followed by a checklist of scenes to add or adjust to reach your desired story:

Does this happen in the script?

Dallas finds creature: Yes. In Scene 7, Dallas finds an injured, bioluminescent creature in the marsh and brings it home.
+1


Makayla also finds creature with Dallas: Close. She doesn't find it with him in the marsh, but she discovers it in his kitchen in Scene 11/12.
+1


Lifegroup Creature freak out: Not yet. The script mentions Lifegroup is scheduled for Thursday at Dallas's house, but the provided text ends before the meeting occurs.
+1


Creature Escapes / Creature Dies: Not yet. The creature is currently alive and being treated by Dallas in an aquarium.
+1


Dark Shadow Fight: Not yet. Dallas sees "dark shadows" in the grass, but there has been no physical fight or marking of the characters so far.


Building the Device: In progress. Dallas and Makayla have discussed his oscillator and how it might track the creatures, but they haven't built a new rescue device yet.
+2

Checklist to reach your plot (Scene-by-Scene Additions)
To align the script with your specific vision, you would need to add or modify the following scenes:

[ ] Scene 14: The Lifegroup Discovery

Action: During the church Lifegroup meeting at Dallas’s house, the creature (likely in the aquarium) is discovered by the group.

Result: Chaos ensues as the neighbors/church members react with fear or wonder (the "freak out").

[ ] Scene 15: The Escape and Death

Action: In the panic of the Lifegroup meeting, the creature escapes into the backyard/marsh.

Action: Dallas and Makayla track it, only to find it has succumbed to its injuries or the environment.

[ ] Scene 16: The Shadow Confrontation


Action: While mourning the creature, the "Dark Shadows" (the spindly figures from Scene 10) emerge from the tall grass.

Action: A physical struggle occurs. The shadows leave physical "marks" on Dallas and Makayla (perhaps bioluminescent burns similar to the ones found in the yard ).

[ ] Scene 17: Engineering the Solution


Action: Realizing the shadows are a threat and the creatures are the key, Makayla and Dallas use the "weird stone" she found  and Dallas’s military-grade oscillators to build a specialized communication/rescue device.

[ ] Scene 18: The Second Rescue

Action: They return to the "Hollow" in the tall grass during the peak of the storm.

Action: They activate the device, which successfully calls to the remaining creatures or protects a new one from the shadows.

[ ] Scene 19: The Departure

Action: The device opens a path or frequency that allows all the creatures to leave the marsh safely.


Action: As they leave, the atmospheric pressure changes, causing the predicted "Nor'easter" to dissipate or move out to sea.

[ ] Scene 20: The Aftermath

Action: The "Storm is missed." The neighborhood is safe, and the tall grass returns to being just grass, though Dallas and Makayla still bear the marks of what happened.


### NEW IDEA

Film
	0. Make an Ellen Review (make it bug colored) - and the ability to highlight and leave comments ;P
	1. Continue to Revise by Hand
	2. Take what wrote - Process it 
	3. Print out - Rest - 
	4. Reconfigure the basic plot of how many times Dallas goes into the Marsh
	5. Show Makayla's Fort? (What if Dominic and Janice live together and Makayla and Asher have basement apartments) - Dallas enters and sees all of their research
	6. Film Repo - Update the 
	7. Have the lifegroup be at DOMINICS - and the reason why they are going to lifegroup is because Makyala stole the creature from Dallas' house and put it in an aquirium - and while they are upstairs Dallas is downstairs and the creature escapes 
		a. Makayla sees creature from Dominics house 
	8. Aftermath of Shadow Encounter - - The Shadows leave biolumminest burn marks on Dallas and Makayla
		a. It is on their forearm - it glows under a light
		b. It is the same burn mark that was on the creature 
	9. In Scene 18 - second rescue - they return to the Hollow and activate their device - which successfully calls the remaining creatures - but also the shadows leave a mark - and then start to chase Dallas and Makayla - - 

Basically:
	- The shadow creature leaves a burn mark - that is only visisble to a certain light - and that Dallas and Makayla have and Dominic has too - and the dark creatures are following them because they have that mark - 
		○ So Dallas and Makayla build something - they put the crystal in their receiver thing - and are able to amplify its tiny signal 

Maybe
	1. The creature 



Sound Design
Hum should feel like its under the marsh - not in the air (low end harmonics)
