# Other Ideas

Miscellaneous director ideas — tone, imagery, casting, design — not tied to a specific scene.

---

- **Sound design**: The hum should feel like it’s *under* the marsh, not in the air. Low end first, then harmonics.
- **Creature design**: Small one = vulnerable, large ones = all shadow and red eyes until the very end. Less is more.
- **Light**: Yellow flicker (small creatures) vs red (predators) in the grass — keep the color language simple.
- **Dallas’s gear**: Military surplus receiver, homemade oscillator, consumer speakers. Nothing sleek.

Add more as they come.

Makayla goes and has a segment where she is talking how the light used to transmist sound instead of using radar. Does that still happen? A man in nintendo did that - did you know that?
