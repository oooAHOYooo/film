# Script Additions

Notes and ideas to add or change in the script. Use this as a running list; you can also add scene-specific additions in each scene’s director note.

## General

- **Phase-cancellation trap**: Where we had pole/perimeter language, consider the acoustic corridor (two speakers, opposing frequencies) as the main visual — no wall, just a kill zone. See Scene 27 note.
- **Tone**: Keep the contrast between Pat Clendenen’s “beautiful southern New England morning” and the hum — one line of radio can do a lot.

## By scene (quick ref)

- **27 The Last Dinner**: Replaced pole perimeter with phase-cancellation trap; replaced fence/wire language with “trap set, not a wall.”
