INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

The creature sleeps in a makeshift box. Dallas has a heat lamp on it. Machines are haphazardly arranged around it—a mini-hospital. The crowd—Dominic, Makayla, Asher—gather around. The creature, like a little bird, responds to the equipment. Curious. Fragile.

Asher enters the room. Makayla follows. Dallas ignores their presence, focused on the creature. Everyone's eyes widen. The creature wakes up. It goes into an almost frozen state—as if it's operating on a different timeline.

Dallas excuses himself. He needs air.

Makayla gently places the sugar cube near the creature. The creature leans toward it. The sound from its back-holes evens out. Makayla slides the sugar cube two inches farther away. She watches what happens.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas stands alone. In a trance. He looks out at the tall grass for a long time. He slowly turns a dial on the receiver. The hum shifts. Almost instantly, something moves deep in the grass. Dallas freezes. He returns the dial to the previous setting. The movement stops.
