### Scene 1: Arrival & Discovery

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: arrival | File: 01_arrival.md*

---

INT. DALLAS' NEW HOUSE - DAY

Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving boxes and a few pieces of furniture.

He hears a noise from outside. Curious, he opens a box marked "EQUIPMENT."

Dallas pulls out a heavy, military-grade receiver. It's covered in dust. He peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.

The photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.

Dallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.

Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.

As he does this, he hears a HUM.

Dallas records readings, but the battery dies.

DALLAS

(to himself)

Damn.

He sets the receiver down and heads for the door.


---


### Scene 2: The Hum

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: 02_the-hum.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD STREET - DAY

Dallas walks into town for batteries. On the way, he meets his neighbor DOMINIC.

DOMINIC

Hey there! You're new guy, right?

DALLAS

Yeah. Dallas.

DOMINIC

Dominic. Nice to meet you. Heading into town?

DALLAS

Just need batteries.

DOMINIC

I'll walk with you. Got some errands myself.

They walk together. As they approach the town center, Dallas notices a row of BIRDS perched on a power line. All facing the direction towards the marsh.

DALLAS

That's... unusual.

DOMINIC

What?

DALLAS

The birds. All facing the same direction.

DOMINIC

(shrugs)

Coastal birds. They do that.

But Dallas can't shake the feeling. Something's off.


---


### Scene 3: The Fellowship

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: fellowship | File: 03_fellowship.md*

---

EXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP HALL - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in a circle with other churchgoers outside, eating at the fellowship hall.

It's the last fellowship hall lunch of the summer. Late summer light filters through the trees.

DOMINIC

This is Sally's famous casserole. You gotta try it.

DALLAS

Thanks.

Dallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted, listening.

DOMINIC

So, what are you here for?

DALLAS

Work.

DOMINIC

At Yale?

DALLAS

Quinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.

DOMINIC

What kind of work?

DALLAS

Bioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh—birds, insects, coyotes. I start next semester.

DOMINIC

Nice. So are you here alone?

DALLAS

Yep.

DOMINIC

Okay cool. That's cool.

They finish eating. The group begins to disperse.

DOMINIC

Want to walk back together? I'll show you around.

DALLAS

Sure.

They start walking towards the marsh, towards the New England coast.

In the far distance, COYOTES HOWL.


---


### Scene 4: Parking Ticket

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: parking-ticket | File: 04_parking_ticket.md*

---

EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

Dallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.

DOMINIC

You have got to be kidding me!

He rips the ticket off, waving it at the empty street.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)

Twelve minutes! I was over twelve minutes. You see this, Dallas? This is where the taxes go. Not to fixing the potholes or the raccoon problem—oh no—it goes to the guy with the ticket book.

DALLAS

Raccoon problem?

DOMINIC

They’re everywhere. Knocking over bins, tearing up siding. Bold, too. They don’t even run anymore.

Dallas isn’t looking at the ticket. He’s looking up. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.

DALLAS

Dominic. Look at the birds.

Dominic glances up, then back at his ticket, uncaring.

DOMINIC

Probably waiting for a hand-out. Come on, let’s get your batteries before I get another fine for standing still.


---


### Scene 5: Marsh Walk

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk | File: 05_marsh_walk.md*

---

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

The sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.

Dominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.

DOMINIC

See this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.

Dallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.

DALLAS

I prefer the raw feed.

DOMINIC

Suit yourself. But there’s a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.

Dallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.


---


### Scene 6: News Vans

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: 06_news_vans.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD COMMON - CONTINUOUS

They reach the town green. Three news vans are parked haphazardly. PAT CLENDENEN, a local weatherman with an overly bright tie, adjusts his earpiece in front of a camera.

PAT CLENDENEN

(to camera)

This afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. 

...and while we’re all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday’s festival, but folks, get those generators ready!

Dominic scoffs as they walk past.

DOMINIC

Pat’s been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.

DALLAS

He mentioned the wind. It’s picking up.

The wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.


---


### Scene 7: Trash Cans

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: trash-cans | File: 07_trash_cans.md*

---

EXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - LATER

They arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.

DOMINIC

Those damn raccoons! I just put these out!

Dominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at his front door, then at Dallas.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)

Look, I gotta clean this up and get the furniture moved before the life group meeting tonight. The kids left the place a wreck. You mind helping me move the heavy sofa? I’ll buy you a beer.

DALLAS

(hesitates)

Sure. Just for a minute.


---


### Scene 8: The Coordinates

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-coordinates | File: 08_the_coordinates.md*

---

INT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The house smells like old wood and floor wax. Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall.

Dallas stops. On the wall is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.

DOMINIC

My wife and kid. They're... gone now.

Dominic looks toward the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged fingernail.

DOMINIC 

I take care of him. He’s had a rough go since the weather changed.

Dominic moves to the window and shuts the blinds halfway, like he’s done it a thousand times.

Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a gnarled finger at the window.

MR. MIKE

She's here.

Dominic is already moving—trying to calm him, trying to stop him.

Mr. Mike scratches faster. Dallas leans in and catches the numbers before Dominic blocks his view.

MR. MIKE 

Forty-five left. Fifteen right.

Dallas freezes. Dominic flips the end table over—the scratchpad numbers disappear against the floorboards.

MR. MIKE

Dominic. 

DOMINIC

Yes Mr. Mike

MR.MIKE
Your sister is here!

---


### Scene 9: Janice Arrival

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: janice-arrival | File: 09_janice_arrival.md*

---

INT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

The front door slams open. JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. Behind her, ASHER (15) and MAKAYLA (22) trudge in, staring at their phones.

JANICE

(spitting out keys)

The traffic on I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why are you cooking the sprouts already? They’ll be mush by the time the group gets here.

DOMINIC

I’m following the recipe, Janice.

JANICE

(inspecting the pot)

You’re boiling them? You’re supposed to roast them! And the gravy—is that a lump?

Janice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas’s heavy receiver on the floor.

JANICE 

What is this? A boat anchor?

DALLAS

It’s a receiver. For work.

Dominic ushers everyone toward the car for a quick errand. The kitchen is a whirlwind of coats, overlapping arguments, and the smell of scorched sprouts.


---


### Scene 10: Equipment Intro

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: equipment-intro | File: 10_equipment_intro.md*

---

INT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Makayla stops by Dallas's equipment. She doesn't look at it with Janice's annoyance; she looks with genuine curiosity.

MAKAYLA

This is military grade. What are you tracking?

DALLAS

Bioacoustics. Sounds in the marsh.

MAKAYLA

Does it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung.

Asher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.

DOMINIC

(yelling from the door)

Everyone in the car! We’re going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!

The family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.


---


### Scene 11: Howie Walk

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: howie-walk | File: 11_howie_walk.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING

The Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the perimeter of his new property.

Dallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become.

DALLAS

(to himself)

What are you?

Howie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.

In the far distance, a single dog barks. Then another. A chain reaction of domestic fear starts in the neighborhood, followed by the high, thin yip of coyotes further inland.

Dallas pulls out his phone. A "Severe Weather Alert" pops up: STORM WARNING.


---


### Scene 12: The First Hum

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-first-hum | File: 12_the_first_hum.md*

---

EXT. EDGE OF THE MARSH - CONTINUOUS

Everything goes still. The wind stops. The waves seem to mute themselves.

Then, the HUM begins.

It starts as a vibration in Dallas's teeth, then moves to his chest. It is a deep, dense, multi-layered sound—a living reed being forced through a massive throat.

Dallas stands in a daze, his hand tightening on Howie’s leash. The tall grass doesn't just sway; it pulses in time with the sound.

DALLAS

(whispering)

That's not the wind.

Howie lets out a low, whimpering growl and tugs hard on the leash, pulling Dallas back toward the safety of the porch.


---


### Scene 13: Shadows in Wind

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: shadows-in-wind | File: 13_shadows_in_wind.md*

---

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.

Shadows—tall, spindly, and darker than the night—grow in the distance. They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships.

He touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long, desperate.

The hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames.

A doorbell is heard off screen breaking Dallas out of his trance. 

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dallas opens the door to find Asher and Dominic.

DOMINIC

Thank you for watching Howie - how did he do? 

DALLAS

Good

Asher looks behind Dallas at all of the equipment. 

DOMINIC

Okay - we'll - we'll be on our way. Hey - are you still okay with hosting lifegroup on Thursday

Dallas
Yeah - that should work out. 

DOMINIC
Okay... Hey - everything okay?

DALLAS
Yeah sorry - just a little tired. 

Dallas and Asher make eye contact and Dallas looks the other way. 



In the darkness of the marsh, something stares back.

## ACT II — The Creature

### Scene 14: The Burn Mark

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-burn-mark | File: 14_the_burn_mark.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - DAWN

The morning air is thick with the scent of ozone. Janice’s minivan idles in the driveway. She drops Howie off, barely waving as she rushes toward the museum to secure artwork before the storm hits.

Makayla and Asher don't follow her. They wander toward the edge of Dallas’s property.

MAKAYLA

Asher, look.

In the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.

Makayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.


---


### Scene 15: Costco Run

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: costco-run | File: 15_costco_run.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC

Life group tonight. Thanks for hosting. I’m heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries?

DALLAS

I’m good.

DOMINIC

Schools are canceled already. The kids are going to be underfoot all day. Try to keep ‘em out of the marsh, alright?

Dominic peels out. Dallas looks at the papers, then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.


---


### Scene 16: Entering Grass

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: entering-grass | File: 16_entering_grass.md*

---

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - DAY

Dallas walks the coastal trail with Howie. Suddenly, the air vibrates. A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds.

Dallas and Howie step onto the narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh. 

As they walk - the air changes into damp, metallic, stillness.

EXT. MARSH ENTRANCE

Dallas and Howie stop at the creek's edge and pan glances towards the outer marsh.

Howie's ears perk and he begins to gently whine, pressing against Dallas’s leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. 

Dallas crouches and lifts him, holding Howie a moment longer than necessary as he catches his breath. Howie's breathing begins to quicken. Dallas steadies him, resting his forehead briefly agaisnt the Howies he steadies him. 

From the distance a light flickers. A light flickers deep in the Marsh. Dallas notices it - but it is gone. 

Dallas lowers Howie to the ground and his equipment begins to beep. 

Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherwordly pattern. 

Dallas clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a pefect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy. Dallas ties 

Dallas is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.

His handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it’s a repeating, melodic pattern.

DALLAS

(to Howie)

Stay here.

He ties Howie’s leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.


---


### Scene 17: The Hollow

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-hollow | File: 17_the_hollow.md*

---

EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS [ACT 2]

The reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves. 

A cry rings out. It’s not a throat-sound; it’s air being forced through something hollow.

Dallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.

A flickering glow emanates from its neck. Its "back-holes"—delicate vents along its spine—vibrate as it breathes, creating the sound that syncs perfectly with Dallas's receiver.


---


### Scene 18: Creature Rescue

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-rescue | File: 18_creature_rescue.md*

---

EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The creature’s pulse is slowing. The glow in its neck dims.

Dallas reaches out, his fingers trembling. As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.

He notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.

As Dallas lifts the fragile thing toward his chest, it lets out a faint, melodic whimper before fainting. The scope in his pocket goes silent.

DALLAS

I've got you.

Suddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the ree

[TODO: finish this beat / complete last line]


---


### Scene 19: The Escape

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-escape | File: 19_the_escape.md*

---

EXT. TALL GRASS - CONTINUOUS

Dallas clutches the creature to his chest, its downy fur damp against his coat. The sound in the grass isn't just wind—it’s a wake. Something heavy is slicing through the reeds, rocketing toward him like an arrow.

DALLAS

(to himself)

Go, go, go.

He breaks into a sprint, stumbling over hidden roots. He reaches the cedar tree. Howie is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass. Dallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is a hundred yards behind them.

He stops at the edge of his driveway, gasping for air. He looks down at his coat. The creature is motionless, but its neck glow pulses a weak, fading amber.


---


### Scene 20: Makeshift Hospital

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: makeshift-hospital | File: 20_makeshift_hospital.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - LATER

Dallas has turned his kitchen island into a triage station. He’s wired a portable oscilloscope to the creature’s head using tiny alligator clips.

The device pulses in a rhythmic, green jagged line—perfectly in sync with the creature's heartbeat.

The creature begins to fade - Dallas turns the dial into another frequency range and waits until it is asleep. 

Makayla 
(to Dallas)
What does that do?

Dallas
(whispering)
It changes the frequency I am transmitting.

Makayla
And you think that it somehow is like talking to the creature?

Dallas
Yes. 

Asher comes in the room and gathers around the creature as well. 

Dallas adjusts the dial on his military receiver to a 115.3 MHz frequency. The creature’s breathing stabilizes. It lets out a low, melodic tone through its back-holes.

Howie sits in the corner, head cocked, shivering. Outside, the world responds: the windows rattle, and a deep, distant hum echoes from the town center.


---


### Scene 21: Life Group Arrives

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: life-group-arrives | File: 21_life_group_arrives.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING

Dominic returns with arms full of Costco boxes. He’s followed by Mr. Mike, who is already muttering and pointing at the basement door.

MR. MIKE

It’s down there! Under the floor! They’re coming for it!

Dominic ignores him, greeting the first family to arrive: JOSH and SARAH, holding their newborn, JP.

DOMINIC

Dallas! You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.

DALLAS

(distracted)

Just... the weather.

Makayla slips past them, her eyes catching Dallas’s. She knows.


---


### Scene 22: Basement Huddle

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: basement-huddle | File: 22_basement_huddle.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Dallas has moved the creature to a shoebox lined with one of his wife’s old sweatshirts. Makayla and Asher crouch beside it.

MAKAYLA

It’s beautiful.

She pulls the sugar cube from her pocket and places it near the creature’s mouth. She takes out her crystal; as it nears the creature, the crystal glows brighter, and Makayla’s hair begins to lift in the static.

ASHER

Is it... talking to us?

DALLAS

It’s vibrating. It’s operating on a different timeline.

A floorboard creaks above. The "Life Group" is growing. They can hear the muffled sounds of small talk and chairs scraping.


---


### Scene 23: The Hymn

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-hymn | File: 23_the_hymn.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The house is packed. Families sit on folding chairs, eating Dominic’s Brussels sprouts. TYLER, a young man with a guitar, hands out music sheets.

TYLER

Let’s start with something to settle the nerves. The storm’s close.

They begin to sing a hymn. As the twenty voices rise in harmony, the hum from the basement begins to harmonize with them. It’s subtle at first, then undeniable.

The floorboards begin to vibrate. The guests look around, confused.

PAT CLENDENEN

(the weatherman)

Must be the wind hitting the eaves. Pressure's dropping fast.

But Dallas is staring at the basement door. The sound isn't the wind. It’s an answer.


---


### Scene 24: Red Eyes

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: red-eyes | File: 24_red_eyes.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - HALL / DEN - NIGHT

The Life Group has departed. Candle shadows dance across the hall. Dallas, wide awake, checks a small video feed of the creature in the den downstairs—temperature, frequency of the earth, the hum of the box. 

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT (same)

Dallas looks out the tall window toward the marsh. In the distance, a pair of bright, dim red eyes. He scans the street: the telephone pole has a red light; something down the block glows red. He looks back at the tall grass. The red eyes are gone.

Closer: the eyes reappear, swirling through the blades, watching the house. Little pulses of red light, inch by inch, toward the edge of the yard.

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - BASEMENT / DEN - NIGHT

Dallas hurries downstairs to check on the creature. The makeshift box is empty. It's gone.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas at the window again. The eyes are gone. The night is still.


---


### Scene 25: Creature Missing

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-missing | File: 25_creature_missing.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Dallas rushes downstairs, Howie whimpering at his heels. He reaches the shoebox. It’s empty.

The window above is unlatched, swinging in the rising wind. Outside, Janice is staring at her minivan, which is covered in strange, scorched patterns.

JANICE

Dallas! What is happening to my car?

Asher points to the siding of the house. A trail of burn marks leads from the basement window toward the marsh. The creature is gone, and the "bad things" are calling it back.


---


## ACT III — The Return

---


### Scene 26: Marsh Confrontation

*ACT III — The Return | ID: marsh-confrontation | File: 26_marsh_confrontation.md*

---

EXT. SALT MARSH - NIGHT

Dallas and Makayla trek through the reeds, guided by the flickering glow of the crystal in Makayla’s pocket.

They find the injured creature. It is surrounded by others of its kind—smaller, birdlike elders waving their hands.

Suddenly, a mist sprays from the elders' backs. Dallas and Makayla freeze, their bodies paralyzed by the hum. Dozens of golden lights rise like lanterns in the mist, but from the shadows, the red eyes emerge, circling the light.


---


### Scene 27: Predator Attack

*ACT III — The Return | ID: predator-attack | File: 27_predator_attack.md*

---

EXT. SALT MARSH - CONTINUOUS

The predators pounce. In a blur of shadow and gnashing sound, the red eyes snatch the golden lights one by one.

Dallas fights the paralysis. He reaches for his frequency dial. He turns it hard—the tiny creature pulses with a blinding light, causing the predators to retract for a split second.

He grabs the creature, but as he pulls it close, the pulsing stops. It’s motionless. The bass scale of the hum drops to a terrifying low. They have to run.


---


### Scene 28: The Perimeter

*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-perimeter | File: 28_the_perimeter.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - NIGHT (STORM)

The storm hits. Dallas, Dominic, and Asher are in the yard, battling the wind. Dallas jams heavy metal poles into the mud at ten-foot intervals.

DALLAS

Asher! The wire!

They string heavy copper wire between the poles, creating a makeshift Faraday fence. Dallas connects his military receiver to the circuit. As he powers it on, the orange indicator light turns green. The perimeter is live.


---


### Scene 29: The Last Dinner

*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-last-dinner | File: 29_the_last_dinner.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

The crew sits at the table in the vibrating house. Dominic and Asher have cooked a silent meal. They eat with their eyes on the windows.

The sound of sniffs and gnarls echoes from the porch. Makayla rattles in her chair. In the corner, Mr. Mike rocks back and forth, his voice a rhythmic chant.

MR. MIKE

One-one-five point three. One-one-five point three.

Suddenly, Makayla snaps. She runs out the door, straight into the tall grass. Dominic and Dallas scramble after her, disappearing into the screaming wind.


---


## ACT IV — Aftermath

---


### Scene 30: Final Echoes

*ACT IV — Aftermath | ID: final-echoes | File: 30_final_echoes.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - MORNING

The sun rises over a quiet Branford. The storm has passed. On the news, Pat Clendenen calls the weather shift a "miracle".

Dallas sits on his porch with Howie. He watches Dominic and Janice pack the kids into the van. They share a look—no words are needed.

Dallas goes inside to his workshop. He plays the old tape of his wife. He hits record, capturing the faint, rhythmic pulse still coming from the marsh. He begins to write—not equations, but an alphabet.

Outside, in the tall grass, a single golden light flickers, then vanishes.

Dallas goes and see's what the fuss is about. It is nothing. 

---
