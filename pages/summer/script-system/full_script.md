<!-- summary: New house, tall grass. He finds a rig in the reeds. Makayla and Asher want his oscillator. -->

EXT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - DAY

Dallas stares at the Tall Grass outside his house as he unloads boxes from a big pile. Dallas scans the new backyard, there are some old rusty lawn furtniture and a picnic table that seems to be adjacent to a fence of grass 

Dallas goes into the grass a little bit and as he does he notices that there is a makeshift trap - a small rig of a stick. Upon further examination he notices that it is not a trap but a recording device of sorts. 

As Dallas examines he hears a distinct bicycle ring.

MAKAYLA, 22 and ASHER, 14 — approach on bikes. Asher has a small spiral notebook in his back pocket; he's tracing something on his palm with his finger as they roll up. They watch Dallas for a while.

They approach Dallas slowly as one of the boxes draws their curiousity. Makayla watches Dallas pull out a military grade Oscillator.

MAKAYLA
(to Asher but loud enough for Dallas to hear)
You know that could be used to track the baseline difference between the cry of the BinzoBee and the howl of the Ophragah.


<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->

(action)
Asher nods. Makayla approaches Dallas. 

MAKAYLA
Hey mister. 

DALLAS
Yes?

MAKAYLA
Is that an Oscillator?

DALLAS
Yes. 

<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->

(action)
Makayla looks at Asher and whispers something in his ear. He nods. She returns glances to Dallas and inches her bike closer. 

MAKAYLA
Do you think my brother Asher could borrow it some time? 

<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->

(action)
Dallas looks at the Oscillator and then at Makayla and Asher

MAKAYLA
He needs it to gather evidence.

DALLAS
What kind of evidence? 

MAKAYLA
Tell him Asher. 

<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->

(action)
Asher stands silent, still tracing a pattern on his palm. Sheepish. He doesn't look up.

MAKAYLA
Does it work?

DALLAS
It does - but you need a power source. 

MAKAYLA
What if we connect audio cables to it - could we put some microphones in the tall grass and it'll reach it.

DALLAS
I suppose. 

MAKAYLA
What if I found a weird stone that pulses when storms approach - would it pick that up?

DALLAS
I'm not sure.

MAKAYLA
Well okay. Asher do you have any questions. 

<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->

(action)
Makayla turns to Asher. He shakes his head no—still not looking up, finger moving on his palm. 

MAKAYLA
Okay then. Byeeeeeee.


<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->

(action)
Makayla and Asher peddle their bikes away. Dallas watches curiously and then peers at the swinging breeze of the tall grass.

# Scene 2: Sierra's Box
<!-- summary: Can't sleep. Golden flicker in the grass. He opens Sierra's box; the hum starts; the battery dies. -->

INT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas struggles to fall asleep in his new home. He hears strange noises from outside. As he looks out the window he sees a flicker of a faint gold light. 

Curious and wide awake - Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving supplies and a few pieces of furniture.

He hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers through his living room window. 

Dallas looks back at a pile of unopened boxes in the middle of his living room. He hestitates but makes his way towards a box marked "Lepidoptera by Sierra".

Dallas opens up the box to find sketches of buttleries - and other insects. 


Dallas pulls out a heavy, a bunch of old vanilla folders, another military-grade desktop Oscillator, a portable audio recorder, an a portable Oscillator. 

One of the folders slips open as he lifts it—inside, a glimpse of hand-drawn sketches and a tab labeled "FIELD NOTES — BRANFORD 2004." Dallas closes it without looking and sets the stack aside.

In the bottom of the box, covered in dust, sumberged by cables,  Dallas finds and old pair of retro red headphones.

On one of the headphones, Dallas peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.

The photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.

Dallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.

Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.

As he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside. The sound is faint and he listens

Dallas walks to the window and attempts to record. The needle spikes. A pure, harmonic tone cuts through the static—a "Golden Note." He holds it. One second. Two. Three. It's clean. It's proof. 

Then—the battery dies. The hum vanishes. But looking down at the tape counter, Dallas sees it: 00:03. He has it. 


Scrambling, Dallas looks through his box of equipment for other devices but they all take C batteries. 

Dallas, fustrated, throws down the equipment and heads for the door. 

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas stands alone watching the tall grass sway agaisnt the salt breeze. The hum seems to be decreasing in scale and size as the night disappears into the distance of the tall marsh grass.

INT. DALLAS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dallas struggles to go to sleep. As he hears more faint cries he looks out the window and sees a faint golden glow again.

### Scene 3: The Hum

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: s03.md*

<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->

<!-- nickname: the-hum -->
<!-- summary: Walk to town with Dominic. Birds pointed at the marsh. Streetlight flickers. Fellowship invite. -->

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NEXT DAY MORNING
Dallas walks outside his house, towards the edge of the property. As he approaches the edge of his yard he watches the tall grass sway in the wind. He looks at the grass for a beat too long, as he nurses the C battery in his hand. As he does so, he becomes dazed.

A faint hum is heard off in the distance of the tall grass - low from the earth. Dallas looks at his watch and begins clicking with his hand. And then he writes down some numbers on a sticky note. "3, 5, 1" 

As Dallas focuses, he notices a man approaching him from the sidewalk near his house. 

DOMINIC AMARANTO, early 40s, wearing a bright salmon covered short sleeve button up approaches Dallas with great vigor. 

DOMINIC
Neighbor!

DALLAS
What's that?

DOMINIC
You are my neighbor - we saw you the other day driving by - did you just move here?

DALLAS
Oh - yeah.

DOMINIC
Nice. Names Dominic.

DALLAS
Dallas.

DOMINIC
Dallas, what a cool name - - What you up to?

DALLAS
I'm just walking into town - got to get some batteries.

DOMINIC
Oh yeah? Where abouts?

DALLAS
Not sure, I was just going to go to the hardware store. 

DOMINIC
So you're walking into town?

DALLAS
Yeah.

DOMINIC
You don't have a car?

DALLAS
No - no car.

DOMINIC
Yeah. Me neither - well I share one with my sister, she's borrowing mine. I was about to go  - there's a hardware store in Branford that could have those batteries. Would you like to tag along?

DALLAS
Sure.

EXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE

Dallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal sidewalks, neighborhoods, and natural marsh fences. As they approach one patch of tall marsh grass in particular, Dallas stops.

Dallas, sheepishly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he mumbles to himself. 

DOMINIC
Be careful - there are coyotes up in that. Some people say the noises are from owls - but I know its coyotes. 



EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

Dallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. 

INT. HARDWARE STORE
<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->

(action)
Dominic waves to the unfriendly man at the counter and brings Dallas to the battery section. 

DOMINIC
So where you from?

DALLAS
Indiana.

DOMINIC
INDIANAAAA - how'd you land up here in Branford?

<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->

(action)
Dallas finds the correct batteries and grabs it off the shelf. 

DALLAS
Work.

DOMINIC
Yeah? Where abouts? Yale?

DALLAS
Quinipiac. 

DOMINIC
That's refreshing... What are you doing with Quinipiac

DALLAS
Mostly field and bioacoustics. 


The building looks closed. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.

DOMINIC
You got to be kidding me!

<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->

(action)
He rips the ticket off and walks around to see if anyone is looking - and finds a secret key. 

As Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.

The streetlight above them flickers. Once. Twice. Then steadies. Dallas watches it for a beat, then looks back at the birds.

Dominic opens the car and gestures Dallas to get in - non-chantanly the parking ticket in the glove box. 

DOMINIC
You hungry?

DALLAS
(still in a daze)
Yeah

DOMINIC
Good -  my church is doing a fellowship lunch - little picnic - I got to go to the bakery and bring a tray. You should come. 

DALLAS
Sure. 

<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->

(action)
DOMINIC
Nice - yeah - it's nice to be the new guy in town - good old branford.

<!-- summary: Church picnic. Dallas meets Makayla and Asher. Janice hands off Howie. -->

EXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in heat of a picnic. Children are running, friends down light summerwear as they play spike ball, and church goers find themselvees are on a long line getting food. Dallas looks around at all of the new faces but does not make great eye contact. Dominic takes a deep breath and approaches the long line. 

Dominic carries a package of water and puts it under one of the fold up tables. As he does so, people look at Dallas and begin to greet him. 

DOMINIC
Alright buddy - let's wait on line I guess. 

<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->

(action)
Dominic and Dallas wait on line to be served at fellowship lunch. As they do people begin to turn around and talk to them. One lady, MARY, 55 turns around and shakes Dallas' hand enthustiaclly.

MARY
Well hey there sunshine

DALLAS
Hello

MARY
Dominic where did you get this Califorina boy from? My name is Mary - do you like chicken primevro?

DALLAS
Never really had it

MARY
Well you should, its great.... So you ready for some proper New England weather?

<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->

(action)
Another turns around and greets Dallas. An older gentleman PAUL WILDLY, 72, 

PAUL
The forecasters say that it is going to be historic one. Hasn't been this bad since 1977 - when Nixon was still in office. Paul, nice to meet you. 

DALLAS
Nice to meet you.

PAUL
Now, where are you from?

DALLAS

PAUL
Oo - then you must know of William Henry Harrison - our 9th president, served as Indiana's governor back when it was just a terriority. 

MARY
Paul, stop that. Honey - if you need I can make you some chicken primevera

DOMINIC
He's okay Ms Mary thank you

DALLAS
Thank you. 

<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->

(action)
Dallas and Dominic sit in a circle of folded pull up chairs. 

JANICE AMARANTO, Mid 50s, taps Dominic's shoulder.

DOMINIC
Sister.

JANICE
Brother. 

DOMINIC
(ignoring Janice)
Dallas, these are my niece and nephew - Makayla and Asher.

<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->

(action)
Makayla and Asher don't say much but wait on line. Asher is doodling in his small spiral notebook—grids, repeating shapes. Makayla taps his shoulder and nods toward the far end of the church lawn. Between the bushes and garden. 

The two leave the line walk over to a corner spot by the end of the church yard and huddle over a pile of brush.

JANICE
So what happened Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Yeah - and it had a ticket.

JANICE
How much. 

DOMINIC
A good amount. 

JANICE
That's great. 

Janice leaves the line of food.

Dallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted by what Makayla and Asher are looking at the distance. 

Janice, noticing that Dallas is a little quiet - tries to spark conversation. 


<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->

(action)
They finish eating. The group begins to disperse.

The sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.

Dominic and Dallas walk quietly for a while. Dominic looks out to the tall grass.

DOMINIC
The kids are always out here with their cameras.

<!-- scene: 05 file: s05.md nickname: marsh-walk-later -->

(action)
Dominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.

DOMINIC

### Scene 6: News Vans & Trash Cans

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: s06.md*

<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->

# Scene 6: News Vans
<!-- summary: News vans in the street. Pat on camera. Burn marks on Dominic's driveway. Dallas stays. -->

EXT. BRANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

Dallas and Dominic reach back to their neighborhood. Outside, nestled between their house, three news vans are parked haphazardly. 

Dominic parks the car and the two get out to see. 

PAT CLENDENEN, MID 50s, is outside their house in front of news cameras. 

PAT CLENDENEN
(to camera)
This afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and the reason we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of Branford, which should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. 
...and while we're all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. 

<div class="script-addition">

> addition


We're also getting reports of rolling brownouts along the Route 146 corridor—UI says it's weather-related surges, but they're sending a crew to check the Branford substation.


</div>


Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday's festival, but folks, get those generators ready!

<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->

(action)
Dominic scoffs as they walk past.

DOMINIC
Pat's been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.

<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->

(action)
The wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.

EXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE 

They arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.

DOMINIC
Look at this. Those raccoons! 

<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->

(action)
Dominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at the garbage cans around his house, then at Dallas.

Dallas notices that there are some weird burn marks on the ground. He gazes at them for a bit of time. 

DOMINIC
Listen, I got to get the furniture before Janice has her women's group tonight. I got to go check on Mike and bring in another fan from the basement. You good? 

DALLAS
(hesitates)
Yeah

DOMINIC
Do you want to stay for a bit?

DALLAS
Sure.

### Scene 7: The Coordinates

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-coordinates | File: s07.md*

---

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

<!-- nickname: the-coordinates -->
<!-- summary: The kids' basement. Mr. Mike scratches numbers. Makayla and Asher grab the coordinates; she wants the oscillator. -->

INT. JACE'S BASEMENT 

Dallas looks around in amazement. The basement is covered with normal basement things - but then there are two beds - and around the corner there is a workstation filled with old CRT machines and what not.

DOMINIC
Yeah, my niece and nephew live here. They moved in a couple of months ago. I keep trying to get them to stay in the guestroom, but they just want to be living in the basement... Here, help me grab the fan. 

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Dallas looks at all of the different equipment scattered across the room. Different audio and aoustic equipment that he seems familiar with. On the wall - there are numbers and marking similar to the three beats he wrote down. 

Dallas and Dominic move the wall fan - as they go to install it. 

INT. DOMINIC'S BASEMENT

Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall. As they move - Dominic knocks over a photo frame - and Dallas grabs it. On the ground is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Dallas grabs the leg of the table and pushes. The two look at the table for a while. 

DOMINIC
Do you have any kids?

DALLAS
No. 

DOMINIC
This was mine. And my wife. 

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Dallas falls mute. 

DOMINIC
Now I just have my niece and nephew. 

Dominic scans the room and finds his gaze upon the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged nail.

DOMINIC 
Mr. Mike! Mr. Mike, what are you doing?! 

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
The camera reveals Mr. Mike to be drawing a complex geometrical pattern
Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a finger at the window.

MR. MIKE
She's here! Hey Dominic! Look - she's here.

DOMINIC
Whose here? Why are you scratching the table?

MR. MIKE
Your sister.

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Dominic dashes for the door and opens it. In pops Janice with Makayla and Asher. 

Dallas meanwhile walks towards Mr. Mike before Dominic blocks his view.

MR. MIKE 
One. ONE. FIVE. THREE. She's here - Dominic - Janice is here - ASHER! - it is playing the same one Elena chased. 

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Makayla and Asher bust through the door. 

Asher rushes over to Mr. Mike—his eyes widen when he sees what Mr. Mike has been writing. He already has his notebook out; he copies the numbers, taps the page twice, then runs to Makayla and shows her. She jots them on her palm. 

Asher hands the coordinates to Makayla. She runs downstairs with them. Dallas watches her. 




INT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. 

JANICE
Traffic the I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why aren't you cooking the sprouts already? We need to boil them first and then sear them. Last time you just boiled them and it was a disgusting mush... Hi Dallas. 

DOMINIC
You got it Janice. Anything for the brussels.  

JANICE
Okay.

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Janice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas's heavy receiver on the floor.

JANICE 
What is this? A boat anchor?

DALLAS
It's a receiver. For work.

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Mr. Mike in the distance begins to get agitated

MR. Mike
And when you hurt one - eventually they will transform into the other one - they wont stay kind forever. If the winds get them - they will take charge.

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Janice walks over and grabs Howie from the car and hands them to Dallas.

JANICE
Do you mind watching Howie for a bit this afternoon? - I have to take everyone to Costco and the lines are going to be longer than my patience.

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Dallas looks at the dog - the dog Howie looks back at the man Dallas. Makayla walks over and grabs the portable Oscillator holding in Dallas' hand. 

MAKAYLA
Have you given any thought to what I asked you the other day?

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Dallas looks at Makayla and back at Asher

MAKAYLA
Let my brother borrow it. 

<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Asher walks over to Mr. Mike to see how he is doing. Makayla approaches Dallas even further. 

MAKAYLA
Does it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung. 

<div class="script-deletion">

> deletion

And the streetlights on our block were doing that thing again—cycling on and off. Every time I hear the sound, the lights go weird.

</div>



<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->

(action)
Asher, meanwhile, stands by the window—notebook closed, held tight. He ignores the conversation, eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind. His finger traces the same ripple on the glass.

DOMINIC
(yelling from the door)
Everyone in the car! We're going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!

The family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.

### Scene 8: Dallas Marsh Walk

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-marsh-walk | File: s08.md*

<!-- scene: 08 file: s08.md nickname: dallas-marsh-walk -->

# Scene 8: The Trailcam
<!-- summary: Trailcam. Waveform ladder. Golden flicker in the hollow. He grabs the injured one—something chases him out. -->
EXT. BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING

The Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the edge of his neighborhood.

As Howie, Dallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become. 

It seems like the readings are pointing closer and closer to his house.

Howie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.

In the far distance, a single coyote barks. Then another. A chain reaction of domestic fear starts in the neighborhood, followed by the high, thin yip of coyotes further inland.

Dallas pulls out his phone. A vibration and an alert for a STORM WARNING pops up.

EXT. EDGE OF THE MARSH - CONTINUOUS

Everything goes still. The wind stops. The waves seem to mute themselves.

Then, the HUM begins.

It starts as a vibration in Dallas's teeth, then moves to his chest. It is a deep, dense, multi-layered sound—a living reed being forced through a massive throat.

Dallas stands in a daze, his hand tightening on Howie's leash. The tall grass pulses in time with the sound.



<div class="script-addition">

> addition


Behind him, the streetlights along the block go dark—all of them, at once. Three seconds of blackout. Then they snap back on, one by one, from the marsh outward, as if the power is being returned in sequence.


</div>


EXT. MARSH TRAIL - EVENING

Dallas walks home with Howie. 

Dallas walks with Howie along the coastal trail. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the tall grass. He carries his portable receiver, the dials clicking softly as he adjusts the frequency.

Dallas stops at the creek's edge and pans his gaze towards the outer marsh. The tall grass stretches endlessly before him, golden-yellow reeds swaying gently despite the lack of wind.

The air is still, too still. No birds. No wind. Just the distant sound of unseen water lapping against the shore.

Dallas steps off the boardwalk onto a narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh.

There in the distance he sees a distubrance. He walks over to a makeshift trap with a trailcam over it. He notices that it is wired to a solar pack and away from itself. 

His equipment begins to beep. Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern.

Howie begins to bark a little - and Dallas stops him. Dallas clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy.

From the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas notices it—but it's gone.

Dallas takes a step forward, then another. The reeds part before him, closing behind him as he disappears into the tall grass.

# Scene 9: The Injured One
<!-- summary:  -->

EXT. INSIDE THE TALL MARSH - SUNSET HOUR

Dallas stands slowly, scanning the reeds around him. Nothing. Just the gentle sway of grass and the sound of his own breathing.

Dallas pushes through a dense curtain of reeds. Dust motes dance in a whirlwind of color refracting the sunset into jagged prisms on his face. 

Dallas steps deeper, following the fading glow. 

All around him is light reeeds blowing in an almost whirlwind of light and color. 

As Dallas' eyes adjust to this new brightness - the world around him slowly fades back to normally. 

There in the distance Dallas sees a gnarled tree that looks a little different than the rest of the trees. 

Dallas approaches the tree and in the bottom of it - lives a small birdlike creature - gently bioluminest - and clearly injured. 

The creature is small. Birdlike, but not a bird - more round. A cloudlike - cottonball, powder-puff. Small round It skin is fluffy pulsing with a soft glow. Round. Covered in dense, dirty white fur like a dandelion seed head. It looks like a small owl. Its large eyes are closed. With no visible mouth, it looks a bit like a living cotton ball with shivering, transulent ears. 

The 

Dallas reaches out. His hand trembles. He touches the creature's back. The creature flinches but doesn't move away. 

Dallas looks at his equipment and it seems to do funny things when he is near it. 

Suddenly, the wind returns. A violent gust. Shadows in the distance start to fill the sky and hover over Dallas and the creature. Dallas in a daze, slowly grabs the creature and gently places it in his jacket and begins to walk out without looking back.

<!-- scene: 10 file: s10.md nickname: shadows-in-wind -->

# Scene 10: The Chase
<!-- nickname: Creature discovery -->

EXT. TALL GRASS - MOMENTS LATER

The air changes.

A heavy, crushing sound slices through the reeds—something massive rocketing toward him like an arrow.

Dallas breaks into a sprint. He reaches the stunted cedar tree—HOWIE is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass.

Dallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is far behind them.

At the edge of his driveway, he finally stops—gasping. The creature is motionless in his coat, but its neck glow pulses weak, fading amber.

# Scene 11: Kitchen Triage
<!-- summary: He runs home with it. Kitchen triage—parchment, macro lens. The creature cries; the equipment flares gold. -->
EXT. COSTAL NEIGHBORHOOD JOURNEY 
Dallas is alone and the evening is getting dark. He dashes back through the coastal neighborhoods with the creature in his jacket - and urges the dog Howie to walk faster - who is not having a good time. Dallas rushes the creature over to the kitchen and upstairs to examine further. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN - DUSK
Dallas rushes to bring the creature inside. He grabs an aluminion pan and lines it with parchment paper. The creature seems to be asleep. 

Howie barks outside. Dallas rushes to grab him.

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Howie is in the living room couch very nervous and peering out the window. The camera pans and finds Dallas alone with the creature trying to understand it as he observes its features with thick macro monoculars. 

As Dallas peers closer, he notices that it has marks underneath its top wing. As Dallas touches the marks the creature suddenly wakes up and lets out a cry.

As the creature cries - Dallas notices that all of the screens on his equipment turn slowly into golden static. The hue gets so vibrant and bright that permant golden marks are left scattered across all of his equipment near the creature. 

The creature lets out a final whimper and slowly falls back to sleep. Dallas - looks at the mark again, as its sparkles and then fades. 

Outside the hum begins again, reverbating the kitchen. 

EXT. DALLAS BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas runs outside with his audio recording equipment in his hand. The hum is growing into a faint roar from the distant marsh. 

As he begins to record - the hum ceases - and he notices that the creature inside is crying loudly. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Dallas approaches it - and notices that the creature, though still seemingly asleep.


INT. DALLAS DESK - NIGHT

Dallas is peered over his computer and begins to look at the recordings of the day. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.

Dallas as he is reading on computer - is holding a little sringe of chemicals that he hopes will replinish the creature. 

He listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.

Dallas plays a recording of Sierra's voice to soothe the creature only to hear her voice dissolve into the creature's ongoing frequency. 

He replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. 

He stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.

His elbow brushes the stack of Sierra's folders. One slides open—a corner of a sketch visible. Something with wings. He pushes it closed without looking. 

As he is listening another burst hits the ongoing recording. Dallas looks up from his desk and peers outside. Another faint glow. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN
Dallas makes his way to the creature. 

Dallas looks at the creature - who is appearing to be drinking water and eating the grass - but is still sleeping inside of a gnarl of the aquarium Dallas has obviously made for it. 


INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.

Dallas goes to look at the creature in his makeshift box. It is breathing. Dallas begins to examine all of the blood - it seems to have darkened. 

He touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long.

The hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames. 

<div class="script-addition">

> addition


The overhead light dims—not a flicker, but a slow, steady drain, as if something is pulling the current out of the walls. Then it returns to full brightness.


</div>



A doorbell is heard off screen breaking Dallas out of his trance.

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dallas opens the door to find Asher and Makayla.

DOMINIC
Thank you for watching Howie - how did he do? 

DALLAS
Good

<!-- scene: 11 file: s11.md nickname: howie-walk-2 -->

(action)
Asher looks behind Dallas at all of the equipment. Dallas hands Howie over to Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Okay - we'll - we'll be on our way. Hey - are you still okay with hosting lifegroup on Thursday

Dallas
Yeah. 

DOMINIC
Okay... Hey - everything okay?

DALLAS
Yeah - sorry - I'm just a little tired. 

DOMINIC
Alright well rest well big guy. 

<!-- scene: 11 file: s11.md nickname: howie-walk-2 -->

(action)
Asher and Dominic and Howie leave and walk into the next side door. Dallas watches them - and then watches the tall grass sway in the wind. 

Dallas rushes to the kitchen and finds that the creature is doing good.

INT. DALLAS DESK

Dallas is alone. He keeps peering through his late wife's old documents.

Dallas lays tiny wires on the creature's head, connecting them to his handheld. When the creature is calm, it emits a low, melodic tone through the holes in its back. HOWIE barks from the corner. The creature's holes shift—the sound becomes a sad cry, like a whimper.

<!-- summary: Burn mark in the grass. The Mother's Vision: a silhouette in the reeds whispers a lullaby. The stake is now personal. -->
EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NEXT MORNING

The morning air is thick with the scent of ozone. Dominic''s minivan idles in the driveway. 

Makayla and Asher don't follow him. They wander toward the edge of Dallas's property.

MAKAYLA
Asher, look.

<!-- scene: 13 file: s13.md nickname: entering-grass -->

(action)
In the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened  burn mark in the grass that resembles beads in paint hitting a white canvas - but on the green grass. It looks as if a drip of yellow blood is around it - acreating a trail. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.

Makayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it.

Makayla notices a trail leading from the edge of the grass toward Dallas.

Janice beeps the car. Makayla and Asher lock eye contact with Dallas and begin to go further. Makayla walks over and talks to her mom.

MAKAYLA
Mom, I am going to stay here.

JANICE
What? Why - what do you have going on here.

MAKAYLA
There are these little burn marks by that.

JANICE
What? Makayla get in the car - someone needs to watch your brother.

MAKAYLA
He's fine. Where's Uncle Dom?

JANICE
He's with Mr. Mike's physical therapist. Makayla get in the car.

Makayla stares at Dallas for a good while - and reads his eyes.

MAKAYLA

DALLAS
Yeah?

MAKAYLA
Yes. 

DALLAS
Okay.

<!-- scene: 13 file: s13.md nickname: entering-grass -->

Makayla turns to the burn marks. 

MAKAYLA
What is that outside your house?

<!-- scene: 13 file: s13.md nickname: entering-grass -->

(action)
Dallas looks outside and sees that there are a bunch of burn marks on the edge of the tall grass. 

A whimper is heard from the kitchen.

(action)
Makayla pushes past Dallas and runs to the kitchen.

Dallas and Makayla hover around the table at the makeshift aquarium Dallas constructed.

ASHER
What is it?

<!-- scene: 13 file: s13.md nickname: entering-grass -->

(action)
Makayla pulls out her portable viewfinder and begins to inspect the creature further. 

MAKAYLA
I am not sure... How long has it been here for?

DALLAS
Around 2 hours.

MAKAYLA
Look at this, look how it breathes.

<!-- scene: 13 file: s13.md nickname: entering-grass -->

(action)
The pair look closer at the creature - it seems to brath through its back. Makayla touches the creature gently - which causes the Oscillator around it to spark.

MAKAYLA
We can't tell anyone about this.

<!-- scene: 13 file: s13.md nickname: entering-grass -->

(action)
Makayla turns to Dallas who nods in agreement.

MAKAYLA
Mr. Dallas, where did you find this?

DALLAS
I am not sure exactly. It was dark. 

MAKAYLA
And why did you grab it?

DALLAS
It looked like it was injured.

MAKAYLA
And is it?

DALLAS
I think so. 

<!-- scene: 13 file: s13.md nickname: entering-grass -->

(action)
Dallas walks over and pulls over his bright electronic lamp over it. Where it shows the different burn marks. 

MAKAYLA
Look at that!


Makayla turns to Dallas. 

MAKAYLA
Great - okay Dallas - where is it. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN

Makayla stand dumbfounded looking at the creature - they can't believe it. They walk around Makayla stares at it for a good while.

# Scene 14: The Vision
<!-- summary: They sit with the creature. Evidence. A bond. Howie at their feet. -->

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN

Dallas watches Makayla from far away as she and Asher look at the creature from afar. 

EXT. DALLAS BACKYARD - OLD PICNIC TABLE 

Makayla and Dallas look on the ground for a while as they sit outside the patio. Howie sleeps peacefully near Dallas' feet nearby.

Asher sits alone a few feet away—drawing in his notebook. Not the creature; repeating shapes, like the burn mark pattern.

MAKAYLA
So your wife was an Epistemologist?

DALLAS
How did you know that?

MAKAYLA
I saw the folder open. Where is she now?

DALLAS
She's gone.

<!-- scene: 14 file: s14.md nickname: creature-rescue -->

(action)
Asher looks at the distance, then the ground, then the tall grass. His finger traces something on his leg—the same pattern, over and over. 

DALLAS
Is Asher okay?

MAKAYLA
He's fine... He's just processing. 

DALLAS
And how are you doing?

MAKAYLA
I'm fine.

DALLAS
What did you see?

MAKAYLA
Not sure... I'm not sure - I feel a bit uninspired. 

<!-- scene: 14 file: s14.md nickname: creature-rescue -->

(action)
Makayla takes a deep breath and looks at Dallas.

MAKAYLA
What do you do when you are sad? Like sad all the time. 

<!-- scene: 14 file: s14.md nickname: creature-rescue -->

(action)
Dallas looks at Howie and then at Makayla.

DALLAS
I don't know.

<!-- scene: 14 file: s14.md nickname: creature-rescue -->

(action)
Dallas and Makayla sit for a while on the long old picnic table outside his house.

MAKAYLA
We need to document this... Dallas. 

<!-- scene: 14 file: s14.md nickname: creature-rescue -->

(action)
Makayla looks at Asher and then back at the house. 

MAKAYLA
We can't tell anyone about this. The sound it made. We should try to record that.

DALLAS
I know that certain frequencies don't record - they repel. 

MAKAYLA
And the frequiences that that creature is making.

DALLAS
It seems to be recording.

MAKAYLA
Recording what? 

DALLAS
Well, everything records in a way. 

MAKAYLA
And what repels.

DALLAS
Things that are usually on the opposite end of the spectrum.

MAKAYLA
So what are we talking about?

<!-- scene: 14 file: s14.md nickname: creature-rescue -->

(action)
The breeze overwhelms them both.


INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - LATER

Makayla and Dallas walk into the kitchen and find the creature sleeping peacefully below the heat lamp. 

MAKAYLA
I've read about fish the way the transmit information. Scientists used to think that the sea was silent - but our ears just can't pick up the right frequenies.

<!-- scene: 14 file: s14.md nickname: creature-rescue -->

(action)
Makayla turns and begins to sketch. 

Dallas has turned his kitchen island into a triage station. He’s wired a portable oscilloscope to the creature’s head using tiny alligator clips.

Makayla begins to sketch the creature. Careful, precise lines. The back-holes. The ears. The glow. She is documenting it the way a scientist would, not the way a teenager would.


The device pulses in a rhythmic, golden jagged line —perfectly in sync with the creature's heartbeat.

In the distance they hear howls - and then silence again. 

The creature begins to fade - Dallas turns the dial into another frequency range and waits until it is asleep. 

Makayla 
(to Dallas)
What does that do?

Dallas
(whispering)
It changes the frequency I am transmitting.

Makayla
And you think that it somehow is like talking to the creature?

Dallas
Yes. 

Asher comes in and gathers around the creature too—notebook in one hand, pencil still. He doesn't draw it. Just watches. His finger traces a small pattern on the edge of the island. 

Dallas adjusts the dial on his military receiver to a 115.3 MHz frequency. The creature's breathing stabilizes. It lets out a low, melodic tone through its back-holes.

Makayla leans over the oscilloscope. She points at the screen. 

Makayla looks at Dallas and then at the creature and pulls out a small prototype from her backpack. 

MAKAYLA
The small device should wake up the creature. 

<!-- scene: 14 file: s14.md nickname: creature-rescue -->

(action)
Makayla turns away from Dallas sight and places the crystal she has found inside a palceholder for where a battery would go on a circut board.

She turns to the creature and turns it on. 

The creature starts to wiggle.

MAKAYLA
Wait. Look at that.

Behind the creature's smooth sine wave, a second signal appears—jagged, arrhythmic. It pulses in sharp, irregular bursts, riding underneath the creature's frequency like static beneath music.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
That's not coming from the creature. That's a draw. It's pulling power.

She looks at Dallas. In the distance a hum emerges

Dallas stares at the secondary wave on the screen. 

Howie sits in the corner, head cocked, shivering. Outside, the world responds: the windows rattle, and a deep, distant hum echoes from the town center.

Makayla goes back inside and huddles around the creature. Makayla presses her crystal next to the creature's neck and has a vision.

Makayla's eyes begin to roll back and she has a vision.

EXT. MAKAYLA'S VISION - MONTAGE

EXT. MARSH - DAY (VISION)

Silence. 

A figure stands in the tall grass. A woman - older, etheral but with Makayla's eyes. She turns and her face is obscured by the sun. She looks down at the creature with sadness and then touches Makayla's forehead.

VOICE (V.O)
Light doesn't leave. It changes.

The woman fades in the sky.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY (Reality)

Makayla gasps, slamming back into her body. 

The doorbell rings.

<!-- summary: Reverse Device mission born. Dallas calibrates the oscillator using Mr. Mike's numbers. A countdown begins. -->

EXT. MAKAYLA'S LAIR 

The crew walk into Makayala's outdoor wigwam with the creature in their makeshift portable box.

INT. MAKAYLA'S LAIR - CONTINUOUS

The crew leave the sleeping creature under a heat lamp in the back corner of the wigwam type lair Makayla has created. 

Makayla gives Dallas a tour of the outdoor lair. Around a lean too structure in the woods - Makayla has built an impressive array of servillance equipment and other home-made gadgetry made from off the shelf components. 

One device in particular intrigues Dallas. 

MAKAYLA
That is a reverse audiophone - capable of taking a recording and then projecting it back into reverse. I built it last summer hoping to better understand how fish communicate.

DALLAS
And how do they?

MAKAYLA
What?

DALLAS
How do the fish communicate?

MAKAYLA
Inconclusive. 

<!-- scene: 15 file: s15.md nickname: the-burn-mark-2 -->

(action)
Asher hands Dallas a small translucent crystal in the shape of a crude pyramid-like stone. He taps it twice against Dallas's palm before letting go—his tell when he's sure about something. 

MAKAYLA
Asher no.

Dallas holds the object in his hands fasicanted. Makayla takes it away and pockets it.

MAKAYLA
That crystal isn't just a stone - it's a biological semi-conductor. 

<!-- scene: 15 file: s15.md nickname: the-burn-mark-2 -->

(action)
Makayla stops and thinks for a moment.

MAKAYLA
Asher, what if Mr Mike's numbers wrent the coordinates we thought they were - but dial settings. 

ASHER
Maybe. I don't know. What do you mean?

MAKAYLA
Dallas, dial in the tune to 11.53

<!-- scene: 15 file: s15.md nickname: the-burn-mark-2 -->

(action)
Dallas changes the notes of his oscillator and suddenly the creature wakes up. 

She rewinds the tapes - and finds the glow - and then the dark shadows grow on the screen and completely decimate the small creature on the ground. 

Makayla looks at the dying creature. 

MAKAYLA
Dallas - could you interpret these readings and compile in your mind or something and tell me what they mean?

<!-- scene: 15 file: s15.md nickname: the-burn-mark-2 -->

(action)
Makayla hands Dallas a bunch of papers to look through. 

MAKAYLA
This crystal - it is a phase inverter. If we run your Oscillator through it - it won't just broadcast sound - it should create a shield - a dome of silence needed to bring it back to its nest.

<!-- scene: 15 file: s15.md nickname: the-burn-mark-2 -->

(action)
Makayla, Dallas, and Asher huddle around the creature. 

INT. LAIR MONTAGE
Makayla and Dallas rig up the dials - Dallas connects the Oscillator into a shoulder rig with the crystal on the center and puts the prototype on the table. 

MAKAYLA
We need to bring this to the place where you found the creature. 

<!-- scene: 15 file: s15.md nickname: the-burn-mark-2 -->

(action)
Makayla turns on the prototype - and nothing happens - but suddenly the creature wakes up and begins to howl loudly - making all of the equipment in the lair act funny.

Asher clutches the creature to his chest. The creature begins to stir—and Asher's notebook slips from his hand. His pencil rolls. He begins to shake. Then he's on the floor. 

MAKAYLA
Asher!

<!-- scene: 15 file: s15.md nickname: the-burn-mark-2 -->

(action)
Makayla runs to rescue Asher who is laying on the floor with his eyes wide open and his mouth wide open.

ASHER
Bring me back. 

<!-- scene: 15 file: s15.md nickname: the-burn-mark-2 -->

(action)
Asher snaps out of it and the crew are visuably shaken. Makayla holds Asher close and whipsers that it will be alright. 

Dallas looks on and then at the equipment. 

MAKAYLA
We have to go. Now.

EXT. MAKAYLA'S LAIR

Makayla and Dallas and Asher begin to make there way hastly out of the woods. They are in a rush to go back to Dallas'.

As they do - they see that dark figures are haunting them - but from a distance. 

MAKAYLA
Asher, what did you see?

ASHER
Not much - I don't really remember.

MAKAYLA
What don't you remember?

ASHER
I don't know. 

MAKAYLA
The creature just gave you a direct communication from an intelligence outside of humanity and you can't tell me what they said or told you? 

ASHER
I guess not. 

<!-- scene: 16 file: s16.md nickname: the-escape -->

(action)
Makayla huffs and walks faster. She circles around the wigwam and looks back at Asher.

MAKAYLA
I'm sorry little brother. 

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE

The crew walk back to Dallas's house. Makayla and Asher walk up to the front door and take Howie who was inside this time. Dominic pulls up and honks the horn.

JANICE
(leaning out the window)
You kids! I said the basement was off limits tonight so you're in Dallas basement now.

MAKAYLA
Dallas, Uncle Dominic can't know about this. No one can. Not until we get more evidence. He'll freak out and make us take it back.

<!-- scene: 16 file: s16.md nickname: the-escape -->

INT. DALLAS MUDROOM - NIGHT (DURING LIFEGROUP)

The sound of the LifeGroup singing "Great Is Thy Faithfulness" is muffled by the heavy basement door. 

MAKAYLA, DALLAS, and ASHER are crouched in the mudroom, shoulder-to-shoulder. Dallas is strapping the Oscillator rig over his jacket. The Crystal is locked in the center, humming with the frequency of a low-voltage wire.

Makayla taps the screen on her portable viewfinder. It’s a mess of jagged red lines.

MAKAYLA
(whispering)
The Shadows are spiking at the Creek Bend. We have ten minutes before the Crystal hits the inversion limit. If it burns out out there, we're blind.

Families arrive in waves. The small kitchen and smaller living room fill. The crowd tries Dominic's toasted Brussels sprouts, passed around on paper plates.

Makayla drifts through the kitchen. She opens drawers quietly. Finds sugar cubes meant for coffee. Pockets one without a word.

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - EVENING

Dallas brings the creature inside. 

The creature begins to fade. Dallas gently places it in the makeshift bed he created the dial to a normal frequency. The creature settles. Sleeps.

HOWIE stays in the corner by the door, disturbed, waiting for his owner. Dallas tries to hide the creature. The moment it cries, the world outside echoes. The ugly hum answers from somewhere far away. The hum floods the town. Windows rattle. 

INT. DALLAS LIVING ROOM

INT. DALLAS'S HALL - MOMENTS LATER

The first family for the life group: a young couple—JOSH and SARAH—with their newborn, JP. They introduce themselves to Dallas. He acts off. Distant. Dominic paces in the kitchen. Mr. Mike mutters in his chair, staring at the weather through the window. It's getting worse.

MR. MIKE
(to himself)
This is all a farce. They should be out there. Return it.

Josh and Sarah know to ignore him. They smile, make small talk. Mr. Mike keeps muttering, almost in frustration.

MR. MIKE
One-one-five point two. Hertz. Hertz.

MAKAYLA 
We have brownies about to be ready.

JOSH
Makayla, how's your mom doing?

MAKAYLA
She's doing better thanks.

MR. MIKE
What is here? What is going on downstairs?!

Dominic steps between Mr. Mike and the stairs. He guides him back by the elbow.

DOMINIC
Easy. Easy. Nothing. Just

MR. MIKE
There is something down there.

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - SAME TIME

Dallas shuffles through a pile of old equipment—mono cables, spare parts. The creature doesn't look like it's doing much. It's breathing, slightly. Dallas struggles to find a bed for it. He settles on an old shoebox—pauses when he sees his wife's handwriting on one, sets that aside—and gently nestles the creature inside. Its little feet curl tightly. It breathes slowly.


He finds a way to poke a hole in something so it can drink. MAKAYLA and ASHER watch from the staircase. Makayla comes down. She takes out the crystal. It begins to glow. Her hair lifts. She and the creature seem to communicate—a beat of shared attention. The creature's glow dims as she pulls her hand away.

INT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

People mill and talk. Someone asks where Dallas is.


DOMINIC
We found a little cat. Dallas is downstairs nursing it.

A woman stands—early fifties, warm.

WOMAN
I'm a retired vet. I could take a look.

DOMINIC
I mean— no, that's okay. I think that cat's just sleeping. We could check after?

An elderly woman nods. Everyone agrees. Someone asks how Howie is doing—where is Howie. JOSH, one of the young couples, leads the group. 

He starts an opening ice breaker. Dallas, Dominic, Makayla, and Asher sit silent.

Getting rough out there

TYLER, 32, a young man with a guitar, hands out music sheets.

TYLER
Would anyone like to say any words before we start?

They begin to sing a hymn. As the voices rise, the hum from the basement begins to rise with them.

MR. MIKE barges through the front door with JANICE guiding him inside. 

MR. MIKE
Where is it? Where is it?

JANICE
Oh, calm down Mr. Mike, we are here now.

TYLER
Hello Mr. Mike - thank you for joining us!






<div class="script-addition">

The overhead lights dim in time with the creature's harmonics—a slow pulse that matches the rhythm of the hymn. Sarah's tea ripples in her cup, concentric rings expanding outward in perfect time.

The hum starts to upset people as it becomes unbearable.

Subtle at first. Then undeniable. The floorboards vibrate. 

<div class="script-addition">

The lights pulse lower and lower.

People look at each other.

AMY
What was that?

<!-- scene: 21 file: s21.md nickname: the-hymn -->

(action)
The group listen in silence.

PAT CLENDENEN
Must be the wind. The boys in the office just texted me that the pressure's dropping fast.

Dallas stares at the basement door. The sound isn't the wind. It's an answer.

During a silent moment of reflection, the hum starts again. Everyone is unsettled. What was that noise? The group settles on the weird weather—the storm, the patterns plaguing Branford. 

In time, people leave. Hugs. Goodbyes. Dominic waves them out. He waits for the last person to leave. Then he rushes downstairs with the kids.

INT. BASEMENT

The creature has escaped!


He searches the kitchen, the hall, haphazard. Makayla makes desperate eye contact with DALLAS, who is by the window with his equipment.

MAKAYLA
Dallas, where is it?

DALLAS
I am not sure. 

The crew search high and low. From a distance Dominic calls them to come upstairs for they are about to do praise reports. 

MAKAYLA
What happened?

Dallas doesn't answer. Makayla reads his face.

MAKAYLA
The creature?

<!-- scene: 21 file: s21.md nickname: the-hymn -->

(action)
Dallas nods. Makayla grabs his device off the table. DOMINIC appears and grabs her wrist. The three of them stand there. From the direction of the marsh—a cry. Distant, unmistakable. The creature. Then the hum, low and everywhere.

Makayla pulls free. She turns to both of them. Her eyes dart in the direction of the tall grass on the edge of Dallas' yard. 

A beat. Dallas stares at her.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
We have to go back.

Dallas looks at the tall grass. At the reading. At her. Then toward the house—Howie. They grab him and start down the trail.

# Scene 22: Sierra's Folder
<!-- summary: They find it in the gnarl. It's fading. Sierra's folder: if the Red-Eyes take them, it's all ghost stories. They'll return it. -->
EXT. DALLAS PORCH

Makayla, Asher and Dallas stand outside. The hum rises. Asher's hand is in his pocket—on the crystal. He's not drawing. 

MAKAYLA
We should go to the fortress—we got to find a way to see what's going on in there.

ASHER
I don't want to go back, Makayla.

MAKAYLA
That's fair. Dallas we'll go.

<!-- scene: 22 file: s22.md nickname: red-eyes -->

(action)
Dominic takes the last package of grocies back into his minivan.



They work in silence—listening, adjusting, mapping the signal. Makayla pulls out Sierra's folder and cross-references a frequency notation with what's on screen. A match.


INT. DALLAS'S STUDY - SAME TIME

Makayla sits cross-legged on the floor. Around her: a scattered pile of folders, cassettes, and loose pages. A label on the box reads "SIERRA." She opens a manila folder and stops. Inside: hand-drawn sketches—anatomical, careful. Golden creatures with back-holes and translucent ears. Dated 1978.

She flips through. More sketches. Frequency notations. A map of the marsh with circles drawn in red ink. Sierra had documented everything.

Makayla carries the folder outside.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

She holds the open folder in front of Dallas. He stares at the sketches. His wife's handwriting. He can't speak.

MAKAYLA
They've been here since the seventies. Hiding in the noise.

She closes the folder. Holds it against her chest.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
If the Red-Eyes take them out tonight, this folder is just a collection of ghost stories. I'm not letting them become a myth again.

Dallas looks at her. Then back at the grass.


</div>



Dominic comes outside.

DOMINIC
Wind's picking up.

Dallas doesn't answer. He's still staring at the grass.

INT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

The room is sparse. Chairs pushed aside. The crew has decided: they'll take it back. Drop it off where they found it.

Dominic, Makayla, and Asher discuss the plan. Asher has his notebook open—1153, the dial numbers, circled. He doesn't add anything. Just watches. Dallas stares blankly, half listening. The hum is back. It fills the silence.

They are the last to leave. Dominic herds the kids toward the door. Dallas stays by the window a moment longer. Then he follows. The house empties. The creature remains in the basement—for now.

<!-- summary: Red eyes at the edge of the yard. The creature's gone. -->


INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - HALL / DEN - NIGHT

Dallas is wide awake. Candle shadows dance across the hall. He checks a small video feed of the creature in the den downstairs—temperature, frequency of the earth, the hum of the box. He picks up the tape recorder sitting next to him on his desk. Presses play.

His late wife's voice. Her theories. The great hum—something she read about as a girl. A long narration. Why she had to stop. He listens.

Dallas looks back to the video monitor, and raises from the bed - the creature is gone!

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT (SAME)

Dallas looks out the tall window toward the marsh while holding the empty cardboard box. His hair blows in the wind. In the distance: a pair of eyes. Bright. Dim. Bright. Red. He looks across the past a telephone pole with a red eyes. Something down the block glows red. He looks back at the tall grass. The red eyes are gone.

He looks again. Closer. The eyes reappear. Swirling through the blades of grass. Watching the house. Little pulses of red light. Inch by inch. Closer to the edge of the yard.

Dallas looks at the burn mark on his forearm - it begins to glow a bit - and then as it does - more howls in the distance engulf the screen.

# Scene 24: The Burn Marks
<!-- summary:  -->

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - MORNING

Dominic into his basement and looks at all of the gear that was previously on the creature. 

EXT. DALLAS BACKYARD

Dallas looks goes to look at the tall grass for a while. 

Out of breath Makayla and Asher come riding with their bicycles.

MAKAYLA
How is the burn mark developed?

<!-- scene: 24 file: s24.md nickname: marsh-confrontation -->

(action)
Makayla sizes up Dallas and reaches for his arm. She holds it - and realizes that the same burn marks that are on the ground - are also on Dallas' arm - and her arm as well. 

MAKAYLA
This isn't good. 

<!-- scene: 24 file: s24.md nickname: marsh-confrontation -->

(action)
Dallas looks at the ground for a long time at the burn mark. It seems to have increased in size and now is forming lines of darkness towards his house, not unlike a corrupt vein system. 

Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows. Makayla follows them. She does some quiet mental math and takes a deep breath.

Dallas looks at all of his gear scattered across the lawn and the picnic table. 

MAKAYLA
Does one of your devices could it be reversed engineered to transmit the sound that you have been recording.

<!-- scene: 24 file: s24.md nickname: marsh-confrontation -->

(action)
Makayla doesn't answer. She grabs one of the portable speakers and positions it on the picnic table. 

DALLAS
I suppose. 

<!-- scene: 24 file: s24.md nickname: marsh-confrontation -->

(action)
A faint hum is heard off in the distance.  Makayla turns to the group. 

Makayla hits the trigger. A sound like a glass crackles under pressure ripples out. 

The grass at the edge of the yard sways rhythimically. Freezing in place. 

Dallas notices that the "vein" burn mark - turns from a dark brown to a dull brown to a light brown - to a dark green. 

MAKAYLA
We have to go back... We will wait for the evening and then strike.... Asher - we need to get the oscillator rigged up - the device is at the lair. 

<!-- scene: 24 file: s24.md nickname: marsh-confrontation -->

(action)
Asher nods and runs off toward his house.

MAKAYLA
But the batteries won't hold for more than a few minutes.

<!-- scene: 24 file: s24.md nickname: marsh-confrontation -->

(action)
Makayla looks and sizes up Dallas.

MAKAYLA
Dallas, you should come too. 

EXT. MAKAYLA'S LAIR - LATE SUN

Makayla and Asher and Dallas sit on a tree log among the Long Island Sound. They watch - as the wind picks up - and the storms clouds make their way. 

MAKAYLA
I really think the storm will pass... It's been 17 years since our mom has passed and we've been living with Dominic and Aunt Janice. 

<!-- scene: 24 file: s24.md nickname: marsh-confrontation -->

Dallas looks onward

Asher brings the final device forward. He checks his notebook once—1153—then hands it to Makayla.

# Scene 25: Into the Marsh
<!-- summary: First confrontation with Dark Creatures. Distinctive weird marks. They have to rescue the light. -->

EXT. EDGE OF THE TALL GRASS

Dallas, Makayla and Asher all stand before the edge of the tallgrass with the shoulder rig device. 

They all take a deep breath as the winds pick up. And enter.

EXT. INSIDE THE TALLGRASS

Dallas, Makayla, and Asher push through the reeds. The same glow they saw before—flickering, faint. They rush toward it. 

Makayla and Dalls find the creature in the middle of the gnarl where Dallas found it initially.

The creature’s pulse is slowing. The glow in its neck dims into a faint amber. 

Dallas reaches out, his fingers trembling. As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.

He notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.

As Dallas lifts the fragile creature toward his chest, it looks out and cries for the crystal—in vain. It faints. The scope in his pocket goes silent.

Suddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the reeds—something massive, rocketing through the blades like an arrow. Dallas gently lowers the creature to the ground.

Behind them it seems like dark chaos is errupting.

In the dark scary chaos that is beyond them - little by little faint pulses of golden light begin to swarm the creature. 

As they inch closer, they see them: a group of creatures, birdlike and small, gathered in a loose circle. They are attending to the injured one—the one from the shoebox. Gentle, urgent.

Dallas and Makayla slow. Asher whines and grabs his head on the floor. The creatures turn and look at Asher in distress. One of them shakes its head and Asher's breathing comes back to normal. 

Suddenly and just then dark figures appear in the distance and the hum begins faintly.

Inch by icnch the hum draws closer.

MAKAYLA
(whispering)
Asher, turn it on. 

<!-- scene: 25 file: s25.md nickname: predator-attack -->

(action)
Asher turns on the device strapped to Makayla's shoulder. He doesn't check his notebook—he knows the numbers. Turns the dial up, plugs in 1, 1, 5, 3. Taps the housing twice. Go. 

The dark creatures begin to swarm the crowd from the edge of a radius among the tall grass. 

Dallas and Makayla hold their arms in pain.

### Scene 26: The Perimeter

<!-- scene: 26 file: s26.md nickname: the-perimeter -->

<!-- nickname: the-perimeter -->
<!-- summary: Retreat with dread: 'They'll come for us.' Shadows at the edge trigger zap episodes. They hatch the plan. -->

EXT. SALT MARSH - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

The younger creatures—two or three—scatter. The elders lift their hands. From their backs, a fine mist sprays out.

Dallas and Makayla stiffen. Their bodies are no longer their own. The hum rolls over them. They are walking backward, away from the circle, step by step. Howie whines, pulled with them.

More lights appear. Dozens of golden glows rise like lanterns in the mist. Then the red eyes. They multiply at the edge of the reeds, contrasting with the gold.

The red eyes begin to circle the golden ones. One by one, in a blur—the mind fills in a predator pouncing—they snatch the lights. The red-eye creatures don't hum. They cancel. Sound disappears the way shadow erases light.


MAKAYLA
(whispering, barely audible)
They're erasing the frequency. Asher turn it on. 

<!-- scene: 26 file: s26.md nickname: the-perimeter -->

(action)
More predators emerge. For every inch they creep, shadow climbs the tall grass. The paralysis holding Dallas and Makayla seems to come from the elders—a last effort to protect the humans—but the elders are no match. The red eyes blink. The small creatures huddle in terror.

Dallas and Makayla move slowly at first, then break into a brisk walk back the way they came. Dallas glances back.

The dark shadow creatures engulf Dallas and Makayla in a chaos of light and fury - while this happens their shadow tentacles hit the invisible barrier of the oscillator, sparks of golden static flying. 

In the distance: the tiny creature. Its pulse blinks large once—then dims. An awful sound of gnashing. Something has it.

Dallas stops. He pulls out the dial. He turns it. The creature's pulse flares again. The predators retract. In that split second, Dallas runs forward, grabs the creature, and runs.

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

Dallas runs with the creature in his coat. He stops. Looks down. The creature has stopped pulsing. It is motionless. He sets it down. Other golden pulses gather around it. The hum drops—lower and lower on the bass scale.

Dallas backs away. Makayla and Asher are already at the edge of the grass. 

Makayla looks down at the stone in her hand. It is no longer a jagged crystal, but a smooth, warm sphere of amber.

He catches up. They don't look back. They make their way out of the tall grass.

EXT. EDGE OF TALL GRASS - DAY

The crew watches from a distance. In the marsh: a battle of pulse and shadow. The red-eyed creatures surround the small ones. They devour them. A mirage of flickering yellow lights against the red. Then it all stops.

The bad creatures turn. They seek the humans.

They 
<!-- scene: 27 file: s27.md nickname: the-last-dinner -->

(action)
Asher has another panic attack on the floor—eyes and mouth open again, out in the cold marsh. No notebook. Just the word. 

ASHER
Run.

DALLAS grabs Asher. 

They run out of the tall grass and don't stop until they're home.

EXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATER

MAKAYLA AND DALLAS are out of breath. Makayla lifts up her arm and there are burn marks. She begins freaking out. 


EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Dallas drags his equipment to the edge of the yard—the oscillator, the military receiver, two speakers he's wired in series. He positions them facing the marsh, angled toward each other, creating a narrow corridor between them. He checks the meter. Adjusts. Checks again.

MAKAYLA watches. She walks over. She pulls Sierra's folder from her jacket. Points to a sketch—a waveform diagram with two opposing frequencies colliding.


Dallas studies her face. Then he adjusts the second speaker, widening the corridor by a foot. Makayla attaches a sensor between the speakers and wires it to Dallas's receiver. The trap is acoustic—invisible. No wall. Just two frequencies waiting to collide.


</div>



Asher gives Dominic a tour of the equipment. He reaches for the dial—then pulls his hand back when it squeals. His finger taps his leg twice instead. He doesn't touch the dial again.



<div class="script-addition">

> addition


The storm rolls in. Makayla runs toward JANICE. Mr. Mike, Asher, and Dominic are outside. Dallas looks stunned, staring into the tall grass. Dominic, without a word, begins to help him position the equipment.

Dallas examines the trap. A small radio plays—PAT CLENDENEN from the news van, welcoming Branford to a beautiful southern New England morning. The contrast is cruel.

The crew stare at the tall grass. The trap is set—not a wall to hide behind, but a kill zone designed to catch a predator. Soon: the crawl of fire engines in the distance. Sea birds. And then the hum.


</div>



Dallas walks back to the house. The crew follows. They wait on the porch. The storm is here.

DOMINIC
This is crazy. What are we doing here.

No one answers.

JANICE

EXT. BRANFORD - DAY

The town is back to normal. People move through their routines. The strange occurrences of the last few days are still on everyone's lips—muted, half-disbelieved.

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE
Dallas looks around at his property—the storm has scattered his equipment. Speakers knocked face-down in the mud. The oscillator on its side, screen cracked. But the sensor Makayla wired between them is still blinking. He picks it up. The screen shows a saved file: one clean recording.

He presses play. The sound fills the yard— it is the tune from the golden furry creatures, captured clean. 

Dallas holds play for a long moment. He looks at the photo of Sierra on his receiver. 

EXT. BRANFORD - OUTSIDE PIZZA PLACE - DAY

PAT CLENDENEN stands outside a choppy PIZZA and POST OFFICE - place in Branford, CT. He is being interviewed by his news crew.

PAT CLENDENEN
The Nor'easter's last-second shift—call it an unlikely miracle. Either way, a good safety warning. This town's prepared now.

Behind him, in the background fog, a faint red-pulsing eye appears. One moment. Then it's gone.

EXT. CHURCH GROUNDS - DAY

A church event. Picnic tables. Nica's catered lunch. DOMINIC and DALLAS greet each other. They don't talk much. They sit next to each other and eat. 

In the distance: Asher and Makayla and some younger kids are crouched near the playground, watching something small. Makayla pulls a jar from her bag. A tiny caterpillar. She eases it inside. Asher has his notebook open—he's drawing the caterpillar, careful lines. He's been drawing a lot since the marsh. Different things. Patterns. Sometimes, from memory, something with wings. 

On the bench next to them: Sierra's folder, open with cross-referenced sketches and observations, the pages labelled "Metamorphosis Cycles"

INT. DALLAS'S WORKSHOP / HOUSE - DAY

Dallas at his desk. He fiddles with a recording mechanism. Wires. A modified receiver. He finally gets it working. He hits record. From outside, the hum from the tall grass bleeds into the room. He listens. He begins to sketch—notations, marks. An alphabet. Something to capture it.

INT. DALLAS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dallas goes to bed. The device sits on the nightstand. He hears echoes. Something beyond the shadows he saw before. He lies there. Listening.

EXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - MORNING

JANICE pulls up. She gets out. She and Dallas hug. She hands him HOWIE's leash. Dallas greets the little dog with real affection. They stare at each other for a while. Howie's ears twitch. He's disturbed by something out in the tall grass. Dallas looks at his watch. Then toward the creek.

EXT. CREEK BEND - DAY

Dallas walks alone with his wife's receiver in hand. The place where the lawn becomes reed. The same bend from before. Dallas stops. He lifts the receiver. He tunes the dial. The hum rises, falls. He adjusts again. The dial clicks into place. He stands there. Recording. The tall grass does not move - and neither does Dallas.
