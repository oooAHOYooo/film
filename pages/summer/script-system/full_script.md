EXT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - DAY

Dallas stares at the Tall Grass outside his house as he loads boxes. 

As Dallas deals with a pile of boxes laid out by a tarp from the moving company. MAKAYLA, 22 and ASHER, 14 - approach him on bikes. They watch him for a while.

They approach Dallas slowly as one of the boxes draws their curiousity. Makayla watches Dallas pull out a military grade Oscillator.

MAKAYLA
(to Asher but loud enough for Dallas to hear)
You know that could be used to track the baseline difference between the cry of the BinzoBee and the howl of the Ophragah.


(action)
Asher nods. Makayla approaches Dallas. 

MAKAYLA
Is that an Oscillator?

DALLAS
Yes. 

MAKAYLA
Do you think my brother Asher could borrow it some time? He and his friends are hunting for evidence around the marsh.

(action)
Dallas looks at the Oscillator and then at Makayla and Asher

DALLAS
What kind of evidence? 

MAKAYLA
Tell him Asher. 

(action)
Asher stands silent in a sheepish shyness.

MAKAYLA
Does it work?

DALLAS
It does - but you need a power source. 

MAKAYLA
What if we connect audio cables to it - could we put some microphones in the tall grass and it'll reach it.

DALLAS
I suppose. 

MAKAYLA
Good to know. Okay - byeeeeeee

(action)
Makayla and Asher leave on bicycle. Dallas watches curiously and then peers at the swinging breeze of the tall grass.

### Scene 2: Dallas Night

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-night | File: 02_dallas-night.md*

---

INT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas struggles to fall asleep in his new home. He hears strange noises from outside. As he looks out the window he sees a flicker of a faint gold light. 

Curious and wide awake - Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving supplies and a few pieces of furniture.

He hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers outside. Curious, he opens a box marked "GENIVE."

Dallas pulls out a heavy, a bunch of old vanilla folders. military-grade desktop Oscillator, a portable audio recorder, an a portable Oscillator. In the bottom of the box, covered in dust, sumberged by cables,  Dallas finds and old pair of retro red headphones. 

On one of the headphones, Dallas peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.

The photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.

Dallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.

Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.

As he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside.

Dallas walks to the window and attempts to record the readings, and just as it capturing something, the battery dies.  

He sets the receiver down and heads for the door.

### Scene 3: The Hum

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: 03_the-hum.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - DAY
Dallas walks outside and watches the tall grass sway in the wind. As he walks he notices a man approaching him from the sidewalk near his house. 


EXT. BRANFORD STREET - DAY

Dallas walks into town. On the way, he meets his neighbor DOMINIC.

DOMINIC
Neighbor!

DALLAS
What's that?

DOMINIC
You are my neighbor - we saw you the other day driving by - did you just move here?

DALLAS
Oh - yeah.

DOMINIC
Nice. Names Dominic.

DALLAS
Dallas.

DOMINIC
Dallas, what a cool name - - What you doing?

DALLAS
I'm just walking into town - got to get some batteries.

DOMINIC
What kind of batteries?

DALLAS
9 Volt should work.

DOMINIC
So you're walking into town?

DALLAS
Yeah.

DOMINIC
You don't have a car?

DALLAS
No - no car.

DOMINIC
Yeah. Me neither - well I share one with my sister, she's borrowing mine. I was about to go get it in town - there's a hardware store in Branford that could have those batteries. Want to walk together?

DALLAS
Sure.

EXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE

Dallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal scenes, and neighborhoods, and sidewalks. As they approach one in particular - a patch of tall marsh grass - Dallas stops.

Dallas, sheepishly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he pulls out a pocket recorder - and points it at the marsh.

DOMINIC
What's with the toy.

DALLAS
Oh, it's an audio recorder.

DOMINIC
Be careful - there are coyotes up in that.

Dallas continues to record.

DOMINIC
Come on champ. Hey - there's a fellowship lunch at my church today, CPC. You should come. Free food. We're going to be late though.

DALLAS
Sure.

EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

Dallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. The building looks closed. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.



DOMINIC
You have got to be kidding me!

(action)
He rips the ticket off, waving it at the empty street.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)
Twelve minutes! I was over twelve minutes. You see this, Dallas? This is where the taxes go. Not to fixing the potholes or the raccoon problem—oh no—it goes to the guy with the ticket book.

(action)
Dominic walks around and wiggles his hand above the car tire - finding a secret key here.

DOMINIC
This is not where it is supposed to go.


(action)
As Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.

DOMINIC
Hey you hungry?

DALLAS
Yeah

DOMINIC
Good - my church is doing a fellowship lunch - little picnic - we'll go first and fuel up before getting the car. Don't worry Pal - we'll get your batteries together. 

INT. CAR - DRIVING TO CPC

Dominic drives from Branford Town Center toward the church. Dallas in the passenger seat.

DOMINIC
So where you from?

DALLAS
Indiana

DOMINIC
Indiana - how'd you land up here in Branford? 

DALLAS
Work

DOMINIC
Yeah? Where abouts

DOMINIC
Yale?

DALLAS
No - maybe - but for now Quinnipiac.

DOMINIC
That's refreshing.

(action)
They pull into the church lot. The fellowship lawn is ahead—picnic in full swing.

### Scene 4: Marsh Walk

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk | File: 04_marsh_walk.md*

---

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

The sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.

Dominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.

DOMINIC

See this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.

(action)
Dallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.

DOMINIC
Your little toy showing you good results?
I prefer the raw feed.

DOMINIC

Suit yourself. But there’s a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.

Dallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.

### Scene 5: The Fellowship

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: fellowship | File: 05_fellowship.md*

---

EXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in heat of a picnic. Children are running, friends in light summerwear play spike ball, and people are on line getting food. Dallas looks around at all of the new faces but does not make eye contact. Dominic takes a deep breath, also appearing a little nervous. 

Dominic carries a package of water and puts it under one of the fold up tables. 

DOMINIC
Alright buddy - let's wait on line I guess. 

(action)
Dominic and Dallas wait on line to be served at fellowship lunch. 

Janice, Mid 50s, puts her hand on Dominic's shoulder.

DOMINIC
Sister.

JANICE
Brother.

DOMINIC
This is Dallas.

DALLAS
Hello.

JANICE
Hey Dallas. Dominic did you get the car?

(action)
MAKAYLA, 22, and ASHER, 15 - emerge behind Janice. 

DOMINIC
(ignoring Janice)
Dallas, these are my niece and nephew - Makayla and Asher.

(action)
Makayla and Asher don't say much but wait online. Makayla taps Asher on the shoulder and nods towards a far end of the church lawn. Between the bushes and garden. 

The two leave the line for food and walk over to it. Dallas watches.

JANICE
So what happened Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Yeah - and it had a ticket.

JANICE
How much. 

DOMINIC
A good amount. 

JANICE
That's great. 

Janice leaves the line of food.

Dallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted, listening.

DOMINIC
So, what are you here for?

DALLAS
Work.

DOMINIC
At Yale?

DALLAS
Quinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.

DOMINIC
What kind of work?

DALLAS
Bioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh—birds, insects, coyotes. I start next semester.

DOMINIC
Nice. So are you here alone?

DALLAS
Yep.

DOMINIC

Okay cool. That's cool.

They finish eating. The group begins to disperse.

DOMINIC

Want to walk back together? I'll show you around.

DALLAS

Sure.

(action)

They start walking towards the marsh, towards the New England coast.

In the far distance, COYOTES HOWL.

### Scene 6: Marsh Trail

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk-later | File: 06_marsh_walk.md*

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

The sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.

Dominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.

DOMINIC

See this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.

(action)

Dallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.

Dominc
What the heck is that?

DALLAS
It's a portable Oscillator. It tells me what kind of low frequencies are in the air - to see if it is worth recording. 



DOMINIC

Suit yourself. But lately - i've heard rumors that there's a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.

(action)
Dallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.

### Scene 7: News Vans & Trash Cans

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: 07_news_vans.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

Dallas and Dominic reach back to their neighborhood. Outside, nestled between their house, three news vans are parked haphazardly. 

Dominic parks the car and the two get out to see. 

PAT CLENDENEN, MID 50s, is outside their house in front of news cameras. 

PAT CLENDENEN
(to camera)
This afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. 
...and while we're all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday's festival, but folks, get those generators ready!

(action)
Dominic scoffs as they walk past.

DOMINIC
Pat's been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.

(action)
Dallas notices that there is some red eyes lurking in the windsill reflections. 

The wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.

EXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - LATER

They arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.

DOMINIC
Those damn raccoons! I just put these out!

Dominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at his front door, then at Dallas.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)
Look, I gotta clean this up and get the furniture moved before the men's group tonight. I got to go check on Mike and bring in another AC unit from the basement. You busy? 

DALLAS
(hesitates)
Sure. 

INT. DOMINIC'S BASEMENT 
Dallas and Dominic move an AC unit - as they go to install it - Dallas notices a strange burn mark on the ground near the tall grass. 

He walks over to it and examines it - he brings out his oscillator and then begins to record it a bit. The readings are off.

### Scene 9: Dallas Home Night

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-home-night | File: 09_dallas_home_night.md*

---

INT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The house smells like old wood and floor wax. Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall.

As they move - Dominic knocks over a photo frame - and Dallas grabs it. On the ground is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.

DOMINIC
My wife and kid. They're... gone now.

(action)
Dallas sheepisly looks at Dominic.

DOMINIC
What about you?

DALLAS
What do you mean?

DOMINIC
Have you have someone that you've lost?

DALLAS
No, I've never really had anyone. 

Dominic looks toward the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged fingernail.

DOMINIC 
Mr. Mike. I take care of him now. He's had a rough go since the weather changed... He doesn't like it at all. 

Dominic moves to the window and shuts the blinds halfway, like he's done it a thousand times.

Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a gnarled finger at the window.

MR. MIKE
She's here.

(action)
Dominic is already moving—trying to calm him, trying to stop him.

Mr. Mike scratches faster. Dallas leans in and catches the numbers before Dominic blocks his view.

MR. MIKE 

Forty-five left. Fifteen right.

Dallas freezes. Dominic flips the end table over—the scratchpad numbers disappear against the floorboards.

MR. MIKE

Dominic. 

DOMINIC

Yes Mr. Mike

MR.MIKE
Your sister is here!

### Scene 10: Janice Arrival

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: janice-arrival | File: 10_janice_arrival.md*

---

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas is home. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.

He listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.

DALLAS
(to himself)
There.

He replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. He's not just listening anymore—he's fitting pieces together.

DALLAS
(whispering)
Forty-five left. Fifteen right.

He stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.

Another burst hits the receiver—deeper, longer. The windows don't rattle yet, but Dallas feels it in his chest. He doesn't look up. He keeps writing. Equations. Approximations. The beginning of a map only he can hear.

Outside, the marsh is dark. Inside, Dallas is wide awake, chasing a signal into the margins.


---


### Scene 11: Howie Walk & The First Hum

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: howie-walk | File: 11_howie_walk.md*

---

INT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

The front door slams open. JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. Behind her, ASHER (15) and MAKAYLA (22) trudge in, staring at their phones.

JANICE
(spitting out keys)
The traffic on I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why are you cooking the sprouts already? They'll be mush by the time the group gets here.

DOMINIC
What should I be making instead?



JANICE
(inspecting the pot)
Brussels are fine - but You're boiling them? You're supposed to roast them!

DOMINIC
Yeah - and then i'm going to sear it.

JANICE
Okay.

(action)

Janice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas's heavy receiver on the floor.

JANICE 
What is this? A boat anchor?

DALLAS
It's a receiver. For work.

INT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Makayla stops by Dallas's equipment. She doesn't look at it with Janice's annoyance; she looks with genuine curiosity.

MAKAYLA
This is military grade. What are you tracking?

DALLAS
Bioacoustics. Sounds in the marsh.

MAKAYLA
Does it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung.

(action)
Asher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.

DOMINIC
(yelling from the door)
Everyone in the car! We're going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!

The family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.

### Scene 12: Shadows in Wind

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: shadows-in-wind | File: 12_shadows_in_wind.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING

The Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the perimeter of his new property.

Dallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become.

DALLAS
(to himself)
What is this?

Howie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.

In the far distance, a single coyote barks. Then another. A chain reaction of domestic fear starts in the neighborhood, followed by the high, thin yip of coyotes further inland.

Dallas pulls out his phone. A "Severe Weather Alert" pops up: STORM WARNING.

EXT. EDGE OF THE MARSH - CONTINUOUS

Everything goes still. The wind stops. The waves seem to mute themselves.

Then, the HUM begins.

It starts as a vibration in Dallas's teeth, then moves to his chest. It is a deep, dense, multi-layered sound—a living reed being forced through a massive throat.

Dallas stands in a daze, his hand tightening on Howie's leash. The tall grass doesn't just sway; it pulses in time with the sound.

DALLAS
(whispering)
That's not the wind.

Howie lets out a low, whimpering growl and tugs hard on the leash, pulling Dallas back toward the safety of the porch.


---


### Scene 13: Howie Walk (Edge of Marsh)

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: howie-walk-2 | File: 13_howie_walk.md*

---

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.

Shadows—tall, spindly, and darker than the night—grow in the distance. They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships.

He touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long, desperate.

The hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames.

A doorbell is heard off screen breaking Dallas out of his trance. 

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dallas opens the door to find Asher and Dominic.

DOMINIC

Thank you for watching Howie - how did he do? 

DALLAS

Good

Asher looks behind Dallas at all of the equipment. 

DOMINIC

Okay - we'll - we'll be on our way. Hey - are you still okay with hosting lifegroup on Thursday

Dallas
Yeah - that should work out. 

DOMINIC
Okay... Hey - everything okay?

DALLAS
Yeah sorry - just a little tired. 

Dallas and Asher make eye contact and Dallas looks the other way. 



In the darkness of the marsh, something stares back.

### Scene 14: The Burn Mark & Costco

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-burn-mark | File: 14_the_burn_mark.md*

EXT. BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING

The Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the perimeter of his new property.

Dallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become.

DALLAS
(to himself)
What are you?

Howie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.

In the far distance, a single dog barks. Then another. A chain reaction of domestic fear starts in the neighborhood, followed by the high, thin yip of coyotes further inland.

Dallas pulls out his phone. A "Severe Weather Alert" pops up: STORM WARNING.

### Scene 15: Entering Grass & The Hollow

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: entering-grass | File: 15_entering_grass.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - DAWN

The morning air is thick with the scent of ozone. Janice's minivan idles in the driveway. She drops Howie off, barely waving as she rushes toward the museum to secure artwork before the storm hits.

Makayla and Asher don't follow her. They wander toward the edge of Dallas's property.

MAKAYLA
Asher, look.

In the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.

Makayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.

EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC
Life group tonight. Thanks for hosting. I'm heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries?

DALLAS
I'm good.

DOMINIC
Schools are canceled already. The kids are going to be underfoot all day. Try to keep 'em out of the marsh, alright?

Dominic peels out. Dallas looks at the papers, then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.

### Scene 16: Creature Rescue

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-rescue | File: 16_creature_rescue.md*

---

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - DAY

Dallas walks the coastal trail with Howie. Suddenly, the air vibrates. A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds.

Dallas and Howie step onto the narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh. 

As they walk - the air changes into damp, metallic, stillness.

EXT. MARSH ENTRANCE

Dallas and Howie stop at the creek's edge and pan glances towards the outer marsh.

Howie's ears perk and he begins to gently whine, pressing against Dallas's leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. 

Dallas crouches and lifts him, holding Howie a moment longer than necessary as he catches his breath. Howie's breathing begins to quicken. Dallas steadies him, resting his forehead briefly against Howie as he steadies him. 

From the distance a light flickers deep in the marsh. Dallas notices it - but it is gone. 

Dallas lowers Howie to the ground and his equipment begins to beep. 

Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern. 

Dallas clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy. He is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.

His handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it's a repeating, melodic pattern.

DALLAS
(to Howie)
Stay here.

He ties Howie's leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.

EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves. 

A cry rings out. It's not a throat-sound; it's air being forced through something hollow.

Dallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.

A flickering glow emanates from its neck. Its "back-holes"—delicate vents along its spine—vibrate as it breathes, creating the sound that syncs perfectly with Dallas's receiver.

### Scene 17: The Burn Mark

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-burn-mark-2 | File: 17_the_burn_mark.md*

---

EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The creature’s pulse is slowing. The glow in its neck dims.

Dallas reaches out, his fingers trembling. As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.

He notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.

As Dallas lifts the fragile thing toward his chest, it lets out a faint, melodic whimper before fainting. The scope in his pocket goes silent.

DALLAS

I've got you.

Suddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the ree

### Scene 18: The Escape

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-escape | File: 18_the_escape.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - DAWN

The morning air is thick with the scent of ozone. Janice's minivan idles in the driveway. She drops Howie off, barely waving as she rushes toward the museum to secure artwork before the storm hits.

Makayla and Asher don't follow her. They wander toward the edge of Dallas's property.

MAKAYLA
Asher, look.

(action)
In the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.

Makayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.

EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC
Life group tonight. Thanks for hosting. I'm heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries?

DALLAS
I'm good.

DOMINIC
Schools are canceled already. The kids are going to be underfoot all day. Try to keep 'em out of the marsh, alright?

Dominic peels out. Dallas looks at the papers, then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.

### Scene 19: Makeshift Hospital

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: makeshift-hospital | File: 19_makeshift_hospital.md*

---

EXT. TALL GRASS - CONTINUOUS

Dallas clutches the creature to his chest, its downy fur damp against his coat. The sound in the grass isn't just wind—it’s a wake. Something heavy is slicing through the reeds, rocketing toward him like an arrow.

DALLAS

(to himself)

Go, go, go.

He breaks into a sprint, stumbling over hidden roots. He reaches the cedar tree. Howie is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass. Dallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is a hundred yards behind them.

He stops at the edge of his driveway, gasping for air. He looks down at his coat. The creature is motionless, but its neck glow pulses a weak, fading amber.

### Scene 20: Entering Grass

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: entering-grass-2 | File: 20_entering_grass.md*

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - LATER

Dallas has turned his kitchen island into a triage station. He’s wired a portable oscilloscope to the creature’s head using tiny alligator clips.

The device pulses in a rhythmic, green jagged line—perfectly in sync with the creature's heartbeat.

The creature begins to fade - Dallas turns the dial into another frequency range and waits until it is asleep. 

Makayla 
(to Dallas)
What does that do?

Dallas
(whispering)
It changes the frequency I am transmitting.

Makayla
And you think that it somehow is like talking to the creature?

Dallas
Yes. 

Asher comes in the room and gathers around the creature as well. 

Dallas adjusts the dial on his military receiver to a 115.3 MHz frequency. The creature’s breathing stabilizes. It lets out a low, melodic tone through its back-holes.

Howie sits in the corner, head cocked, shivering. Outside, the world responds: the windows rattle, and a deep, distant hum echoes from the town center.

### Scene 21: Life Group Arrives

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: life-group-arrives | File: 21_life_group_arrives.md*

---

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - DAY

Dallas walks the coastal trail with Howie. Suddenly, the air vibrates. A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds.

Dallas and Howie step onto the narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh. 

As they walk - the air changes into damp, metallic, stillness.

EXT. MARSH ENTRANCE

Dallas and Howie stop at the creek's edge and pan glances towards the outer marsh.

Howie's ears perk and he begins to gently whine, pressing against Dallas's leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. 

Dallas crouches and lifts him, holding Howie a moment longer than necessary as he catches his breath. Howie's breathing begins to quicken. Dallas steadies him, resting his forehead briefly against Howie as he steadies him. 

From the distance a light flickers deep in the marsh. Dallas notices it - but it is gone. 

Dallas lowers Howie to the ground and his equipment begins to beep. 

Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern. 

Dallas clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy. He is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.

His handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it's a repeating, melodic pattern.

DALLAS
(to Howie)
Stay here.

He ties Howie's leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.

EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves. 

A cry rings out. It's not a throat-sound; it's air being forced through something hollow.

Dallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.

A flickering glow emanates from its neck. Its "back-holes"—delicate vents along its spine—vibrate as it breathes, creating the sound that syncs perfectly with Dallas's receiver.

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING

Dominic returns with arms full of Costco boxes. He’s followed by Mr. Mike, who is already muttering and pointing at the basement door.

MR. MIKE

It’s down there! Under the floor! They’re coming for it!

Dominic ignores him, greeting the first family to arrive: JOSH and SARAH, holding their newborn, JP.

DOMINIC

Dallas! You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.

DALLAS

(distracted)

Just... the weather.

Makayla slips past them, her eyes catching Dallas’s. She knows.

### Scene 23: The Hymn

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-hymn | File: 23_the_hymn.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Dallas has moved the creature to a shoebox lined with one of his wife’s old sweatshirts. Makayla and Asher crouch beside it.

MAKAYLA

It’s beautiful.

She pulls the sugar cube from her pocket and places it near the creature’s mouth. She takes out her crystal; as it nears the creature, the crystal glows brighter, and Makayla’s hair begins to lift in the static.

ASHER

Is it... talking to us?

DALLAS

It’s vibrating. It’s operating on a different timeline.

A floorboard creaks above. The "Life Group" is growing. They can hear the muffled sounds of small talk and chairs scraping.

### Scene 24: Red Eyes

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: red-eyes | File: 24_red_eyes.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

The house is packed. Families sit on folding chairs, eating Dominic’s Brussels sprouts. TYLER, a young man with a guitar, hands out music sheets.

TYLER

Let’s start with something to settle the nerves. The storm’s close.

They begin to sing a hymn. As the twenty voices rise in harmony, the hum from the basement begins to harmonize with them. It’s subtle at first, then undeniable.

The floorboards begin to vibrate. The guests look around, confused.

PAT CLENDENEN

(the weatherman)

Must be the wind hitting the eaves. Pressure's dropping fast.

But Dallas is staring at the basement door. The sound isn't the wind. It’s an answer.

### Scene 25: Creature Missing

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-missing | File: 25_creature_missing.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - HALL / DEN - NIGHT

The Life Group has departed. Candle shadows dance across the hall. Dallas, wide awake, checks a small video feed of the creature in the den downstairs—temperature, frequency of the earth, the hum of the box. 

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT (same)

Dallas looks out the tall window toward the marsh. In the distance, a pair of bright, dim red eyes. He scans the street: the telephone pole has a red light; something down the block glows red. He looks back at the tall grass. The red eyes are gone.

Closer: the eyes reappear, swirling through the blades, watching the house. Little pulses of red light, inch by inch, toward the edge of the yard.

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - BASEMENT / DEN - NIGHT

Dallas hurries downstairs to check on the creature. The makeshift box is empty. It's gone.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas at the window again. The eyes are gone. The night is still.

### Scene 26: Marsh Confrontation

*ACT III — The Return | ID: marsh-confrontation | File: 26_marsh_confrontation.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Dallas rushes downstairs, Howie whimpering at his heels. He reaches the shoebox. It’s empty.

The window above is unlatched, swinging in the rising wind. Outside, Janice is staring at her minivan, which is covered in strange, scorched patterns.

JANICE

Dallas! What is happening to my car?

Asher points to the siding of the house. A trail of burn marks leads from the basement window toward the marsh. The creature is gone, and the "bad things" are calling it back.

### Scene 27: Predator Attack

*ACT III — The Return | ID: predator-attack | File: 27_predator_attack.md*

---

EXT. SALT MARSH - NIGHT

Dallas and Makayla trek through the reeds, guided by the flickering glow of the crystal in Makayla’s pocket.

They find the injured creature. It is surrounded by others of its kind—smaller, birdlike elders waving their hands.

Suddenly, a mist sprays from the elders' backs. Dallas and Makayla freeze, their bodies paralyzed by the hum. Dozens of golden lights rise like lanterns in the mist, but from the shadows, the red eyes emerge, circling the light.


---


### Scene 28: The Perimeter

*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-perimeter | File: 28_the_perimeter.md*

---

EXT. SALT MARSH - CONTINUOUS

The predators pounce. In a blur of shadow and gnashing sound, the red eyes snatch the golden lights one by one.

Dallas fights the paralysis. He reaches for his frequency dial. He turns it hard—the tiny creature pulses with a blinding light, causing the predators to retract for a split second.

He grabs the creature, but as he pulls it close, the pulsing stops. It’s motionless. The bass scale of the hum drops to a terrifying low. They have to run.

### Scene 29: The Last Dinner

*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-last-dinner | File: 29_the_last_dinner.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - NIGHT (STORM)

The storm hits. Dallas, Dominic, and Asher are in the yard, battling the wind. Dallas jams heavy metal poles into the mud at ten-foot intervals.

DALLAS

Asher! The wire!

They string heavy copper wire between the poles, creating a makeshift Faraday fence. Dallas connects his military receiver to the circuit. As he powers it on, the orange indicator light turns green. The perimeter is live.

### Scene 30: Final Echoes

*ACT IV — Aftermath | ID: final-echoes | File: 30_final_echoes.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

The crew sits at the table in the vibrating house. Dominic and Asher have cooked a silent meal. They eat with their eyes on the windows.

The sound of sniffs and gnarls echoes from the porch. Makayla rattles in her chair. In the corner, Mr. Mike rocks back and forth, his voice a rhythmic chant.

MR. MIKE

One-one-five point three. One-one-five point three.

Suddenly, Makayla snaps. She runs out the door, straight into the tall grass. Dominic and Dallas scramble after her, disappearing into the screaming wind.
