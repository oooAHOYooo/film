EXT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - DAY

Dallas stares at the Tall Grass outside his house as he unloads boxes from a big pile. 

MAKAYLA, 22 and ASHER, 14 - approach on bikes. They watch him for a while.

They approach Dallas slowly as one of the boxes draws their curiousity. Makayla watches Dallas pull out a military grade Oscillator.

MAKAYLA
(to Asher but loud enough for Dallas to hear)
You know that could be used to track the baseline difference between the cry of the BinzoBee and the howl of the Ophragah.


(action)
Asher nods. Makayla approaches Dallas. 

MAKAYLA
Hey mister. 

DALLAS
Yes?

MAKAYLA
Is that an Oscillator?

DALLAS
Yes. 

(action)
Makayla looks at Asher and whispers something in his ear. He nods. She returns glances to Dallas and inches her bike closer. 

MAKAYLA
Do you think my brother Asher could borrow it some time? 

(action)
Dallas looks at the Oscillator and then at Makayla and Asher

MAKAYLA
He needs it to gather evidence.

DALLAS
What kind of evidence? 

MAKAYLA
Tell him Asher. 

(action)
Asher stands silent in a sheepish shyness.

MAKAYLA
Does it work?

DALLAS
It does - but you need a power source. 

MAKAYLA
What if we connect audio cables to it - could we put some microphones in the tall grass and it'll reach it.

DALLAS
I suppose. 

MAKAYLA
What if I found a weird stone that pulses when storms approach - would it pick that up?

DALLAS
I'm not sure.

MAKAYLA
Well okay. Asher do you have any questions. 

(action)
Makayla turns to Asher. He shakes his head no. 

MAKAYLA
Okay then. Byeeeeeee.


(action)
Makayla and Asher peddle their bikes away. Dallas watches curiously and then peers at the swinging breeze of the tall grass.

### Scene 2: Dallas Night

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-night | File: 02_dallas-night.md*

---

INT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas struggles to fall asleep in his new home. He hears strange noises from outside. As he looks out the window he sees a flicker of a faint gold light. 

Curious and wide awake - Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving supplies and a few pieces of furniture.

He hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers through his living room window. 

Dallas looks back at a pile of unopened boxes in the middle of his living room. He hestitates but makes his way towards a box marked "Sierra".

Dallas pulls out a heavy, a bunch of old vanilla folders, another military-grade desktop Oscillator, a portable audio recorder, an a portable Oscillator. In the bottom of the box, covered in dust, sumberged by cables,  Dallas finds and old pair of retro red headphones. 

On one of the headphones, Dallas peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.

The photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.

Dallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.

Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.

As he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside.

Dallas walks to the window and attempts to record the readings, and just as it capturing something, the battery dies.  

He sets the receiver down and heads for the door.

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE

Dallas stands alone watching the tall grass sway agaisnt the salt breeze. 


---


### Scene 3: The Hum

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: 03_the-hum.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NEXT DAY MORNING
Dallas walks outside and watches the tall grass sway in the wind. As he walks he notices a man approaching him from the sidewalk near his house. 

DOMINIC, early 40s, wearing a bright salmon covered short sleeve button up approaches Dallas with great vigor. 

DOMINIC
Neighbor!

DALLAS
What's that?

DOMINIC
You are my neighbor - we saw you the other day driving by - did you just move here?

DALLAS
Oh - yeah.

DOMINIC
Nice. Names Dominic.

DALLAS
Dallas.

DOMINIC
Dallas, what a cool name - - What you up to?

DALLAS
I'm just walking into town - got to get some batteries.

DOMINIC
What kind of batteries?

DALLAS
9 Volt should work.

DOMINIC
So you're walking into town?

DALLAS
Yeah.

DOMINIC
You don't have a car?

DALLAS
No - no car.

DOMINIC
Yeah. Me neither - well I share one with my sister, she's borrowing mine. I was about to go get it in town - there's a hardware store in Branford that could have those batteries. Want to walk together?

DALLAS
Sure.

EXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE

Dallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal scenes, and neighborhoods, and sidewalks. As they approach one in particular - a patch of tall marsh grass - Dallas stops.

Dallas, sheepishly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he pulls out a pocket recorder - and points it at the marsh.

DOMINIC
What's with the gadget?

DALLAS
Oh, it's an audio recorder.

DOMINIC
Be careful - there are coyotes up in that.

(action)
Dallas continues to record.

EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

Dallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. The building looks closed. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.

DOMINIC
You have got to be kidding me!

(action)
He rips the ticket off and walks around to see if anyone is looking - and finds a secret key. 

As Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.

Dominic opens the car and gestures Dallas to get in - non-chantanly the parking ticket in the glove box. 

DOMINIC
Hey you hungry?

DALLAS
(still in a daze)
Yeah

DOMINIC
Good - tomorrow my church is doing a fellowship lunch - little picnic - I am bringing in a tray.


DOMINIC
So where you from?

DALLAS
Indiana

DOMINIC
Indiana - how'd you land up here in Branford? 

DALLAS
Work

DOMINIC
Yeah? Where abouts

DOMINIC
Yale?

DALLAS
No - maybe - but for now Quinnipiac.

DOMINIC
That's refreshing.

### Scene 4: Marsh Trail

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk-later | File: 04_marsh_walk.md*

---

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

The sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.

Dominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.

DOMINIC

See this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.

(action)

Dallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.

Dominc
What the heck is that?

DALLAS
It's a portable Oscillator. It tells me what kind of low frequencies are in the air - to see if it is worth recording. 



DOMINIC

Suit yourself. But lately - i've heard rumors that there's a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.

(action)
Dallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.

### Scene 5: News Vans & Trash Cans

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: 05_news_vans.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

Dallas and Dominic reach back to their neighborhood. Outside, nestled between their house, three news vans are parked haphazardly. 

Dominic parks the car and the two get out to see. 

PAT CLENDENEN, MID 50s, is outside their house in front of news cameras. 

PAT CLENDENEN
(to camera)
This afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. 
...and while we're all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday's festival, but folks, get those generators ready!

(action)
Dominic scoffs as they walk past.

DOMINIC
Pat's been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.

(action)
The wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.

EXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE 

They arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.

DOMINIC
Those raccoons! 

(action)
Dominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at the garbage cans around his house, then at Dallas.

Dallas notices that there are some weird burn marks on the ground. He gazes at them for a bit of time. Dominic continues to clean the mess from the garbage and Dallas continues to help not  paying attention to what Dominic is handing him, first a garbage bag, then a leaf bag, then up to - but helping none the less. 

DOMINIC
Listen, I got to get the furniture moved before the men's group tonight. I got to go check on Mike and bring in another AC from the basement. You good? 

DALLAS
(hesitates)
Yeah

DOMINIC
Do you want to stay for a bit?

DALLAS
Sure. 


---


### Scene 6: The Coordinates

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-coordinates | File: 06_the_coordinates.md*

---

INT. DOMINIC'S BASEMENT 
Dallas and Dominic move an AC unit - as they go to install it. 

He walks over to it and examines it - he brings out his oscillator and then begins to record it a bit. The readings are off.

INT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM 

Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall. As they move - Dominic knocks over a photo frame - and Dallas grabs it. On the ground is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.

DOMINIC
My wife and kid... Gone now. Dallas grab the leg

(action)
Dallas grabs the leg of the table and pushes. The two look at the table for a while. 

DOMINIC
What about you?

DALLAS
What do you mean?

DOMINIC
Have you have someone that you've lost?

(action)
Dallas falls mute. Dominic scans the room and finds his gaze upon the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged nail.

DOMINIC 
Mr. Mike! Hey - what are you doing? 

(action)
Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a finger at the window.

MR. MIKE
She's here! Hey Dominic! Look - she's here.

DOMINIC
Whose hear? Why are you scratching the table?

MR. MIKE
Your sister.

(action)
Dominic dashes for the door and opens it. In pops Janice with Makayla and Asher. 

Dallas meanwhile walks towards Mr. Mike before Dominic blocks his view.

MR. MIKE 
Forty-five left. Fifteen right. She's here - Dominic - Janice is here - ASHER! - it is playing the same one Elena chased. 

(action)
Asher rushes over to Mr. Mike and eye's widen when he see's what he has been writing. Asher runs to Makayla - who starts to jot the numbers on the table on her palm. 


INT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. 

JANICE
Traffic the I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why aren't you cooking the sprouts already? We need to boil them first and then sear them. Last time you just boiled them and it was a disgusting mush... Hi Dallas. 

DOMINIC
You got it Janice. Anything for the brussels.  

JANICE
Okay.

(action)

Janice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas's heavy receiver on the floor.

JANICE 
What is this? A boat anchor?

DALLAS
It's a receiver. For work.

(action)
Mr. Mike in the distance begins to get agitated

MR. Mike
And when you hurt one - eventually they will transform into the other one - they wont stay kind forever. If the winds get them - they will take charge.

(action)
Janice walks over and grabs Howie from the car and hands them to Dallas.

JANICE
Do you mind watching Howie for a bit this afternoon - I have to take everyone to costco

(action)
Dallas looks at the dog - the dog Howie looks back at the man Dallas. Makayla walks over and grabs the portable Oscillator holding in Dallas' hand. 

MAKAYLA
Have you given any thought to what I asked you the other day?

(action)
Dallas looks at Makayla and back at Asher

MAKAYLA
Let my brother borrow it. 

(action)
Asher walks over to Mr. Mike to see how he is doing. Makayla approaches Dallas even further. 

MAKAYLA
Does it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung.

(action)
Asher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.

DOMINIC
(yelling from the door)
Everyone in the car! We're going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!

The family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.

### Scene 7: Dallas Marsh Walk

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-marsh-walk | File: 07_dallas_marsh_walk.md*

---

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - EVENING

Dallas walks home with Howie. 

Dallas walks with Howie along the coastal trail. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the tall grass. He carries his portable receiver, the dials clicking softly as he adjusts the frequency.

The air is still, too still. No birds. No wind. Just the distant sound of unseen water lapping against the shore.

Dallas steps off the boardwalk onto a narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh.

There in the distance he sees a distubrance. He walks over to a makeshift trap with a trailcam over it. He notices that it is wired to a solar pack and away from itself. Howie runs up to it and smells it. 

EXT. MARSH ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Dallas stops at the creek's edge and pans his gaze towards the outer marsh. The tall grass stretches endlessly before him, golden-yellow reeds swaying gently despite the lack of wind.

His equipment begins to beep. Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern.

Howie begins to bark a little - and Dallas stops him 
He clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy.

From the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas notices it—but it's gone.

Dallas takes a step forward, then another. The reeds part before him, closing behind him as he disappears into the tall grass.

EXT. TALL GRASS - CONTINUOUS

The reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through, his receiver spiking with each step. The hum grows louder, more insistent.

He stops. Listens. Something is moving in the grass ahead of him—something large, moving against the wind.

He stands slowly, scanning the reeds around him. Nothing. Just the gentle sway of grass and the sound of his own breathing.

Dallas turns and begins to make his way back, the receiver still recording, still searching for a signal that has vanished as quickly as it appeared.

### Scene 8: Dallas Night Work

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-night-work | File: 08_dallas_home_night.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Dominic arrives to pick up Howie.

DOMINIC
Hey man - sorry for the crazy day - how's Howie?

DALLAS
He's doing good. 

DOMINIC
Great - do you think you could him tomorrow as well?

DALLAS
Um

DOMINIC
It's okay - think about it... Hey - tomorrow - Listen - we got a free picnic - we should all go.

DALLAS
What time

DOMINIC
Around 3 - or 4 - or 5 - not sure - but I'll ring you - we'll go.

DALLAS
Sounds good.

(action)
Dominic picks back Howie up.

INT. DALLAS DESK - NIGHT

Dallas is peered over his computer and begins to look at the recordings of the day. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.

He listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.

He replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. 

He stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.

As he is listening another burst hits the ongoing recording. Dallas looks up from his desk and peers outside. Another faint glow. 

---


### Scene 9: The Fellowship

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: fellowship | File: 09_fellowship.md*

---

EXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in heat of a picnic. Children are running, friends in light summerwear play spike ball, and people are on line getting food. Dallas looks around at all of the new faces but does not make eye contact. Dominic takes a deep breath, also appearing a little nervous. 

Dominic carries a package of water and puts it under one of the fold up tables. 

DOMINIC
Alright buddy - let's wait on line I guess. 

(action)
Dominic and Dallas wait on line to be served at fellowship lunch. 

Janice, Mid 50s, puts her hand on Dominic's shoulder.

DOMINIC
Sister.

JANICE
Brother.

DOMINIC
This is Dallas.

DALLAS
Hello.

JANICE
Hey Dallas. Dominic did you get the car?

(action)
MAKAYLA, 22, and ASHER, 15 - emerge behind Janice. 

DOMINIC
(ignoring Janice)
Dallas, these are my niece and nephew - Makayla and Asher.

(action)
Makayla and Asher don't say much but wait online. Makayla taps Asher on the shoulder and nods towards a far end of the church lawn. Between the bushes and garden. 

The two leave the line for food and walk over to it. Dallas watches.

JANICE
So what happened Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Yeah - and it had a ticket.

JANICE
How much. 

DOMINIC
A good amount. 

JANICE
That's great. 

Janice leaves the line of food.

Dallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted, listening.

DOMINIC
So, what are you here for?

DALLAS
Work.

DOMINIC
At Yale?

DALLAS
Quinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.

DOMINIC
What kind of work?

DALLAS
Bioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh—birds, insects, coyotes. I start next semester.

DOMINIC
Nice. So are you here alone?

DALLAS
Yep.

DOMINIC
Okay cool. That's cool.

(action)
They finish eating. The group begins to disperse. Janice walks over to Dallas and hands him Howie again.

### Scene 10: Shadows in Wind

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: shadows-in-wind | File: 10_shadows_in_wind.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING

The Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the perimeter of his new neighborhood.

Dallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become.

Howie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.

In the far distance, a single coyote barks. Then another. A chain reaction of domestic fear starts in the neighborhood, followed by the high, thin yip of coyotes further inland.

Dallas pulls out his phone. A vibration and an alert for a STORM WARNING pops up.

EXT. EDGE OF THE MARSH - CONTINUOUS

Everything goes still. The wind stops. The waves seem to mute themselves.

Then, the HUM begins.

It starts as a vibration in Dallas's teeth, then moves to his chest. It is a deep, dense, multi-layered sound—a living reed being forced through a massive throat.

Dallas stands in a daze, his hand tightening on Howie's leash. The tall grass doesn't just sway; it pulses in time with the sound.

Howie lets out a low, whimpering growl and tugs hard on the leash, pulling Dallas back toward the safety of the porch.


---


### Scene 11: Howie Walk (Edge of Marsh)

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: howie-walk-2 | File: 11_howie_walk.md*

---

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.

Shadows—tall, spindly, and darker than the night—grow in the distance. They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships.

He touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long.

The hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames.

A doorbell is heard off screen breaking Dallas out of his trance. 

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dallas opens the door to find Asher and Dominic.

DOMINIC
Thank you for watching Howie - how did he do? 

DALLAS
Good

(action)
Asher looks behind Dallas at all of the equipment. Dallas hands Howie over to Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Okay - we'll - we'll be on our way. Hey - are you still okay with hosting lifegroup on Thursday

Dallas
Yeah. 

DOMINIC
Okay... Hey - everything okay?

DALLAS
Yeah - sorry - I'm just a little tired. 

DOMINIC
Alright well rest well big guy. 

(action)
Asher and Dominic and Howie leave and walk into the next side door. Dallas watches them - and then watches the tall grass sway in the wind.

### Scene 12: The Burn Mark & Costco

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-burn-mark | File: 12_the_burn_mark.md*

---

INT. DALLAS BEDROOM NIGHT

Dallas can't sleep. His receivers start to beep off. He walks outside.

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE
Dallas finds the courage to walk outside and goes into the tall grass. There he sees a faint glow - as he approaches he notices that there is a group of creatures huddling around the gnarl of an old tree. The creature is biolumenist - much like a firefly - the other creatures scatter into the marsh as if they were little orbs of golden light - but remains is one, smaller than the rest, injured and letting a cry out. 

As it cries out - Dallas' equipment begins to pulse and spike. 

---


### Scene 13: Entering Grass & The Hollow

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: entering-grass | File: 13_entering_grass.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - DAWN

The morning air is thick with the scent of ozone. Janice's minivan idles in the driveway. She drops Howie off, barely waving as she rushes toward the museum to secure artwork before the storm hits.

Makayla and Asher don't follow her. They wander toward the edge of Dallas's property.

MAKAYLA
Asher, look.

In the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.

Makayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.

EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC
Life group tonight. Thanks for hosting. I'm heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries?

DALLAS
I'm good.

DOMINIC
Schools are canceled already. The kids are going to be underfoot all day. Try to keep 'em out of the marsh, alright?

Dominic peels out. Dallas looks at the papers, then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.


---


### Scene 14: Creature Rescue

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-rescue | File: 14_creature_rescue.md*

---

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - DAY

Dallas walks the coastal trail with Howie. Suddenly, the air vibrates. A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds.

Dallas and Howie step onto the narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh. 

As they walk - the air changes into damp, metallic, stillness.

EXT. MARSH ENTRANCE

Dallas and Howie stop at the creek's edge and pan glances towards the outer marsh.

Howie's ears perk and he begins to gently whine, pressing against Dallas's leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. 

Dallas crouches and lifts him, holding Howie a moment longer than necessary as he catches his breath. Howie's breathing begins to quicken. Dallas steadies him, resting his forehead briefly against Howie as he steadies him. 

From the distance a light flickers deep in the marsh. Dallas notices it - but it is gone. 

Dallas lowers Howie to the ground and his equipment begins to beep. 

Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern. 

Dallas clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy. He is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.

His handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it's a repeating, melodic pattern.

DALLAS
(to Howie)
Stay here.

He ties Howie's leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.

EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves. 

A cry rings out. It's not a throat-sound; it's air being forced through something hollow.

Dallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.

A flickering glow emanates from its neck. Its "back-holes"—delicate vents along its spine—vibrate as it breathes, creating the sound that syncs perfectly with Dallas's receiver.


---


### Scene 15: The Burn Mark

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-burn-mark-2 | File: 15_the_burn_mark.md*

---

EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The creature’s pulse is slowing. The glow in its neck dims.

Dallas reaches out, his fingers trembling. As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.

He notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.

As Dallas lifts the fragile thing toward his chest, it looks out and cries for the crystal—in vain. It faints. The scope in his pocket goes silent.

Suddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the reeds—something massive, rocketing through the blades like an arrow. Dallas grabs the creature into his coat and rushes out. Howie does not like this. He freaks out. Dallas, the creature, and Howie make the long journey back to the house.


---


### Scene 16: The Escape

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-escape | File: 16_the_escape.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - DAWN

The morning air is thick with the scent of ozone. Janice's minivan idles in the driveway. She drops Howie off, barely waving as she rushes toward the museum to secure artwork before the storm hits.

Makayla and Asher don't follow her. They wander toward the edge of Dallas's property.

MAKAYLA
Asher, look.

(action)
In the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.

Makayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.

EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC
Life group tonight. Thanks for letting us use your house. I'm heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries?

DALLAS
I'm good.

DOMINIC
Schools are canceled already. The kids are going to be underfoot all day. Try to keep 'em out of the marsh, alright?

Dominic peels out. Dallas looks at the papers, then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.

### Scene 17: Makeshift Hospital

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: makeshift-hospital | File: 17_makeshift_hospital.md*

---

EXT. TALL GRASS - CONTINUOUS

Dallas clutches the creature to his chest, its downy fur damp against his coat. The sound in the grass isn't just wind—it’s a wake. Something heavy is slicing through the reeds, rocketing toward him like an arrow.

DALLAS

(to himself)

Go, go, go.

He breaks into a sprint, stumbling over hidden roots. He reaches the cedar tree. Howie is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass. Dallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is a hundred yards behind them.

He stops at the edge of his driveway, gasping for air. He looks down at his coat. The creature is motionless, but its neck glow pulses a weak, fading amber.


---


### Scene 18: Entering Grass

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: entering-grass-2 | File: 18_entering_grass.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - LATER

Dallas has turned his kitchen island into a triage station. He’s wired a portable oscilloscope to the creature’s head using tiny alligator clips.

The device pulses in a rhythmic, green jagged line—perfectly in sync with the creature's heartbeat.

The creature begins to fade - Dallas turns the dial into another frequency range and waits until it is asleep. 

Makayla 
(to Dallas)
What does that do?

Dallas
(whispering)
It changes the frequency I am transmitting.

Makayla
And you think that it somehow is like talking to the creature?

Dallas
Yes. 

Asher comes in the room and gathers around the creature as well. 

Dallas adjusts the dial on his military receiver to a 115.3 MHz frequency. The creature’s breathing stabilizes. It lets out a low, melodic tone through its back-holes.

Howie sits in the corner, head cocked, shivering. Outside, the world responds: the windows rattle, and a deep, distant hum echoes from the town center.

### Scene 19: Life Group Arrives

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: life-group-arrives | File: 19_life_group_arrives.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - EVENING

Dallas brings the creature inside. The outdoor porch oscilloscope—still wired from earlier—begins to pulse, almost in sync with the creature's heartbeat.

The creature begins to fade. Dallas turns the dial to a normal frequency. The creature settles. Sleeps.

HOWIE stays in the corner by the door, disturbed, waiting for his owner. Dallas tries to hide the creature. The moment it cries, the world outside echoes. The ugly hum answers from somewhere far away. The hum floods the town. Windows rattle.

Dallas adjusts the dial again. The creature quiets.

EXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

DOMINIC's car pulls up. He gets out alone—no Janice—arms full of haphazard Costco boxes. He heads for the house.

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Dominic comes through the door. He sets the boxes down.

DOMINIC
Thanks again for letting the life group meet tonight. Really. You okay?

MR. MIKE walks in behind him. He takes one look at the room and freaks out—like a dog afraid of thunder. He points at the basement door.

MR. MIKE
What is here? What is going on downstairs?!

Dominic steps between Mr. Mike and the stairs. He guides him back by the elbow.

DOMINIC
Easy. Easy. Nothing. Just—

MAKAYLA walks in. She spots the creature. Without a word, without fear, she goes to it and tends to its wound. The creature's glow begins to brighten under her touch.

ASHER joins the huddle. Dominic turns.

DOMINIC
Everybody—calm down. Just—

He sees the creature. He goes still. Then he pushes everyone out of the way and stares.

DOMINIC
What is that?

### Scene 20: Basement Huddle

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: basement-huddle | File: 20_basement_huddle.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - EVENING (CONTINUOUS)

Dominic is flabbergasted. He sits. The crew huddle around the kitchen table. No one speaks. Dominic gets up and locks the front door without looking at it.

Dallas lays tiny wires on the creature's head, connecting them to his handheld. When the creature is calm, it emits a low, melodic tone through the holes in its back. HOWIE barks from the corner. The creature's holes shift—the sound becomes a sad cry, like a whimper.

Dominic can't take the quiet. He starts to argue.

DOMINIC
Could be some kind of bird. From the ground. Something that nests in the marsh.

MR. MIKE
You're all wrong.

MAKAYLA
We should put it back where we found it. We can't have it in the house.

MR. MIKE
We need to leave now. They're coming for it. It's not safe here.

Dominic stands. The crew scramble—they have to move the creature before anyone else arrives. They head for the basement.

The doorbell chimes.

INT. DALLAS'S HALL - MOMENTS LATER

The first family for the life group: a young couple—JOSH and SARAH—with their newborn, JP. They introduce themselves to Dallas. He acts off. Distant. Dominic paces in the kitchen. Mr. Mike mutters in his chair, staring at the weather through the window. It's getting worse.

MR. MIKE
(to himself)
This is all a farce. They should be out there. Return it.

Josh and Sarah know to ignore him. They smile, make small talk. Mr. Mike keeps muttering, almost in frustration.

MR. MIKE
One-one-five point two. Hertz. Hertz.

Dallas glances at the basement door. Downstairs, the creature is hidden. For now.

### Scene 21: The Hymn

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-hymn | File: 21_the_hymn.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Families arrive in waves. The small kitchen and smaller living room fill. The crowd tries Dominic's toasted Brussels sprouts, passed around on paper plates.

Makayla drifts through the kitchen. She opens drawers quietly. Finds sugar cubes meant for coffee. Pockets one without a word.

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - SAME TIME

Dallas shuffles through a pile of old equipment—mono cables, spare parts. The creature doesn't look like it's doing much. It's breathing, slightly. Dallas struggles to find a bed for it. He settles on an old shoebox—pauses when he sees his wife's handwriting on one, sets that aside—and gently nestles the creature inside. Its little feet curl tightly. It breathes slowly.

He finds a way to poke a hole in something so it can drink. MAKAYLA and ASHER watch from the staircase. Makayla comes down. She takes out the crystal. It begins to glow. Her hair lifts. She and the creature seem to communicate—a beat of shared attention. The creature's glow dims as she pulls her hand away.

INT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

People mill and talk. Someone asks where Dallas is.

DOMINIC
We found a little cat. Dallas is downstairs nursing it.

A woman stands—early fifties, warm.

WOMAN
I'm a vet. I could take a look.

DOMINIC
I mean—should we stop the prayer? I think that cat's just sleeping. We could check after?

An elderly woman nods. Everyone agrees. Someone asks how Howie is doing—where is Howie. JOSH, one of the young couples, leads the group. He starts an opening ice breaker. Dallas, Dominic, Makayla, and Asher sit silent.

TYLER, a young man with a guitar, hands out music sheets.

TYLER
Something to settle the nerves. Storm's close.

They begin to sing a hymn. As the voices rise, the hum from the basement begins to rise with them. Subtle at first. Then undeniable. The floorboards vibrate. People look at each other.

PAT CLENDENEN
(Branford's weatherman, life group regular)
Must be the wind. Pressure's dropping fast.

Dallas stares at the basement door. The sound isn't the wind. It's an answer.

During a silent moment of reflection, the hum starts again. Everyone is unsettled. What was that noise? The group settles on the weird weather—the storm, the patterns plaguing Branford. In time, people leave. Hugs. Goodbyes. Dominic waves them out. He waits for the last person to leave. Then he rushes downstairs with the kids.

### Scene 22: Red Eyes

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: red-eyes | File: 22_red_eyes.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

The creature sleeps in a makeshift box. Dallas has a heat lamp on it. Machines are haphazardly arranged around it—a mini-hospital. The crowd—Dominic, Makayla, Asher—gather around. The creature, like a little bird, responds to the equipment. Curious. Fragile.

Asher enters the room. Makayla follows. Dallas ignores their presence, focused on the creature. Everyone's eyes widen. The creature wakes up. It goes into an almost frozen state—as if it's operating on a different timeline.

Dallas excuses himself. He needs air.

Makayla gently places the sugar cube near the creature. The creature leans toward it. The sound from its back-holes evens out. Makayla slides the sugar cube two inches farther away. She watches what happens.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas stands alone. In a trance. He looks out at the tall grass for a long time. He slowly turns a dial on the receiver. The hum shifts. Almost instantly, something moves deep in the grass. Dallas freezes. He returns the dial to the previous setting. The movement stops.

Dominic comes outside.

DOMINIC
Wind's picking up.

Dallas doesn't answer. He's still staring at the grass.

INT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

The room is sparse. Chairs pushed aside. The crew has decided: they'll take it back. Drop it off where they found it.

Dominic, Makayla, and Asher discuss the plan. Dallas stares blankly, half listening. The hum is back. It fills the silence.

They are the last to leave. Dominic herds the kids toward the door. Dallas stays by the window a moment longer. Then he follows. The house empties. The creature remains in the basement—for now.


---


### Scene 23: Creature Missing

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-missing | File: 23_creature_missing.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - HALL / DEN - NIGHT

Dallas is wide awake. Candle shadows dance across the hall. He checks a small video feed of the creature in the den downstairs—temperature, frequency of the earth, the hum of the box. He picks up the tape recorder sitting next to him on his desk. Presses play.

His late wife's voice. Her theories. The great hum—something she read about as a girl. A long narration. Why she had to stop. He listens. He goes to bed with her voice still in his head.

Dallas looks back to the video monitor but the creature is gone!

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT (SAME)

Dallas looks out the tall window toward the marsh. In the distance: a pair of eyes. Bright. Dim. Bright. Red. He looks across the street—the telephone pole has a red light. Something down the block glows red. He looks back at the tall grass. The red eyes are gone.

He looks again. Closer. The eyes reappear. Swirling through the blades of grass. Watching the house. Little pulses of red light. Inch by inch. Closer to the edge of the yard.

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT / DEN - NIGHT

Dallas makes his way downstairs to check on the creature. The makeshift box is empty. The creature is gone.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas at the window again. The eyes are gone. The night is still.

### Scene 24: Marsh Confrontation

*ACT III — The Return | ID: marsh-confrontation | File: 24_marsh_confrontation.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - DAY (NEXT MORNING OR LATER)

Dallas rushes downstairs. HOWIE whimpers at his heels. He reaches the shoebox. It's empty. The window above is unlatched. Swinging in the wind.

EXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

JANICE gets out of her car and stops. Her minivan is covered in strange, scorched patterns—burn marks. She pulls out her phone. Takes a photo. Scrapes one mark with her key.

ASHER stands beside her. He follows the trail with his eyes. Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows. A path. Something left. Something came for the creature.

ASHER
Mom. Look.

JANICE
Dallas! What is happening to my car?

She can't find him. Inside, Dallas is already in the backyard—staring at the marsh with his oscillator. The creature is gone. The bad things are calling it back. The trail of burn marks points the way.


---


### Scene 25: Predator Attack

*ACT III — The Return | ID: predator-attack | File: 25_predator_attack.md*

---

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - DAY

MR. MIKE barges through the front door. MAKAYLA chases after him.

MR. MIKE
Where is it? Where is it?

He searches the kitchen, the hall, haphazard. Makayla makes desperate eye contact with DALLAS, who is by the window with his equipment.

EXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

JANICE gets out of her car and stops. Strange burn marks run along the minivan's panels. She pulls out her phone, takes a photo, then scrapes one mark with her key.

ASHER, beside her, follows the trail with his eyes. Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows.

ASHER
Mom. Look.

Janice can't find Dallas. Inside, he's in the backyard, staring at the marsh with his oscillator. He moves a pole slightly and checks the read again.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Makayla watches from a distance. She walks over, picks up another pole, and plants it. She adjusts a wire. Dallas's reading on the handheld jumps. He looks over. A beat. He acknowledges her.

They work in silence—digging, planting poles, stringing wire. A makeshift fence taking shape around the edge of the property.

MAKAYLA
What happened?

Dallas doesn't answer. Makayla reads his face.

MAKAYLA
The creature?

Dallas nods. Makayla grabs his device off the table. DOMINIC appears and grabs her wrist. The three of them stand there. From the direction of the marsh—a cry. Distant, unmistakable. The creature. Then the hum, low and everywhere.

Makayla turns to Dallas.

MAKAYLA
We have to go get it back. The bad creatures want to kill it.

Dallas looks at the tall grass. At the reading. At her. Then toward the house—Howie. They grab him and start down the trail.

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

Dallas, Makayla, and Howie push through the reeds. The same glow they saw before—flickering, faint. They rush toward it. The trail leads toward the salt marsh. As they inch closer, they see them: a group of creatures, birdlike and small, gathered in a loose circle. They are attending to the injured one—the one from the shoebox. Gentle, urgent.

Dallas and Makayla slow. Howie whines. The creatures have not yet scattered. For a moment, it looks like help. Like a family.


---


### Scene 26: The Perimeter

*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-perimeter | File: 26_the_perimeter.md*

---

EXT. SALT MARSH - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

The younger creatures—two or three—scatter. The elders lift their hands. From their backs, a fine mist sprays out.

Dallas and Makayla stiffen. Their bodies are no longer their own. The hum rolls over them. They are walking backward, away from the circle, step by step. Howie whines, pulled with them.

More lights appear. Dozens of golden glows rise like lanterns in the mist. Then the red eyes. They multiply at the edge of the reeds, contrasting with the gold.

The red eyes begin to circle the golden ones. One by one, in a blur—the mind fills in a predator pouncing—they snatch the lights. The red-eye creatures don't hum. They cancel. Sound disappears the way shadow erases light.

More predators emerge. For every inch they creep, shadow climbs the tall grass. The paralysis holding Dallas and Makayla seems to come from the elders—a last effort to protect the humans—but the elders are no match. The red eyes blink. The small creatures huddle in terror.

Dallas and Makayla move slowly at first, then break into a brisk walk back the way they came. Dallas glances back.

In the distance: the tiny creature. Its pulse blinks large once—then dims. An awful sound of gnashing. Something has it.

Dallas stops. He pulls out the dial. He turns it. The creature's pulse flares again. The predators retract. In that split second, Dallas runs forward, grabs the creature, and runs.

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

Dallas runs with the creature in his coat. He stops. Looks down. The creature has stopped pulsing. It is motionless. He sets it down. Other golden pulses gather around it. The hum drops—lower and lower on the bass scale.

Dallas backs away. Makayla and Howie are already at the edge of the grass. He catches up. They don't look back. They make their way out of the tall grass.

### Scene 27: The Last Dinner

*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-last-dinner | File: 27_the_last_dinner.md*

---

EXT. EDGE OF TALL GRASS - DAY

The crew watches from a distance. In the marsh: a battle of pulse and shadow. The red-eyed creatures surround the small ones. They devour them. A mirage of flickering yellow lights against the red. Then it all stops.

The bad creatures turn. They seek the humans.

DOMINIC
Run.

They run out of the tall grass and don't stop until they're home.

EXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATER

Dallas sits in the kitchen, silent. Then he gets up. No debate. He goes outside and starts digging.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Dallas jams heavy poles into the mud. He takes copper wire and hangs it between them. He pauses, moves one pole back a few feet, checks the meter again.

MAKAYLA paces the distance between poles with heel-to-toe steps. The tone on the receiver drops—spreading wider but losing strength.

ASHER gives Dominic a tour of the equipment, explaining what each component does. Asher reaches for the dial, then pulls his hand back when it squeals.

The storm rolls in. Makayla runs toward JANICE. Mr. Mike, Asher, and Dominic are outside. Dallas looks stunned, staring into the tall grass. He keeps going—poles, wire. Dominic, without a word, begins to help him.

Dallas examines the perimeter. A small radio plays—PAT CLENDENEN from the news van, welcoming Branford to a beautiful southern New England morning. The contrast is cruel.

Dallas jams the last pole into the mud. The crew stare at the tall grass. The decision is unspoken: leave the creature. Dallas and Makayla dig. Soon: the crawl of fire engines in the distance. Sea birds. And then the hum.

Dallas walks back to the house. The crew follows. They wait on the porch. The perimeter is up. The storm is here.

DOMINIC
This is crazy. What are we doing here.

No one answers.

### Scene 28: Final Echoes

*ACT IV — Aftermath | ID: final-echoes | File: 28_final_echoes.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATE DAY (STORM)

The sun sets. The crew peer out at the yard and the tall grass.

DOMINIC
Let's have some dinner.

He wipes the counter hard. A cup tips over. Mr. Mike nods from his chair.

MR. MIKE
Good time to eat.

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Dominic and Asher cook. Makayla and Dallas share a glance at the window—Dallas watching the weather, the perimeter, the grass.

They eat standing, plates in hand, taking turns at the window. Outside, the noise grows. Sniffs. Gnarls. The creatures. Makayla rattles in her chair, impatient.

MAKAYLA
What should we do?

Dominic looks defeated. Dallas says nothing. Mr. Mike rocks in his chair, muttering. He taps the same three beats on the armrest, over and over.

MR. MIKE
One-one-five point three. One-one-five point three.

Dominic is hesitant. He asks Dallas for answers about the field. Dallas doesn't have them. Dominic argues they should focus on boarding up the house for the storm.

As he speaks—Makayla bolts. She runs out the back door, cutting across the yard toward the reeds before anyone can grab her.

The sound spikes once. Sharper. Shorter. Then it cuts.

Makayla snatches the crystal from her pocket and sprints. Dominic chases her. He can't reach her in time. He hesitates at the edge of the tall grass. He cries her name. Asher and Dallas reach the grass and stare.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas powers on the makeshift poles. Howie cowers next to him. Mr. Mike watches from the window. Dominic rushes past for flashlights. He tries to call Makayla on the two-way radio—Asher has the other walkie. Dominic tells Dallas to watch Mr. Mike and Howie. He hesitates, then heads into the grass.

Dallas waits with Howie on the porch. He watches his equipment. The blinking orange light turns green. He hurries over to inspect. The indicator: green, then orange pulses.

The storm approaches. The two of them pace. Mr. Mike, inside, hears the thunder and yells.

MR. MIKE
They're coming! They're coming!

Dallas secures the fence. A distant cry. Then the low hum. Night falls. The winds pick up. Eyes circulate in the fields. Dominic grabs Dallas's sleeve. Dallas pulls free without turning around.

Dallas brings Howie inside. He sets the leash on the hook like he'll be back in a minute. He rubs Howie's face. Leaves the porch light on. Then he heads out to the tall grass.

EXT. TALL GRASS - NIGHT

A strange silence engulfs Dallas despite the wind. He sees a glimmer of fading light and moves toward it. The sensation of being watched almost overwhelms him. He keeps going.

He stops. Pulls a crumpled napkin from his pocket. Opens it: 45 L 15 R. It matches his equipment. The compass on the device.

In the distance: Makayla, holding one of the creatures. Asher and Dominic sit next to her, dazed. Makayla's eyes are fading as Dallas approaches. In her hands, the creature makes its calls. Little by little, dark eyes appear around them. Another creature of the same size emerges and begins to nurture the one she holds.

Dallas makes contact with the creature. The creature begins to sing. The crew are paralyzed—and so are the dark forces. They cower away. The storm rages. The creatures retreat into their holes in the gnarls of the soft trees.

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT / DAWN

Dallas, Dominic, and Makayla sit by the window and watch for the night to end. It does.

EXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - MORNING

Morning. Dallas is still making calculations. Then he stops. He puts his equipment in the trash. The crew leaves. Dallas is alone again.

He looks outside. The soft sound—the pulse of the creature—returns. Faint. There. He listens.

### Scene 29: Aftermath

*ACT IV — Aftermath | ID: aftermath | File: 29_aftermath.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD - DAY

The town is back to normal. People move through their routines. The strange occurrences of the last few days are still on everyone's lips—muted, half-disbelieved.

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE
Dallas looks around at his property - he sees that the wind has knocked over his poles. 

INT. TV STUDIO / NEWS SET - DAY

PAT CLENDENEN at the anchor desk. Behind him, a window or screen shows southern New England—fog, clearing skies.

PAT CLENDENEN
The Nor'easter's last-second shift—call it an unlikely miracle. Either way, a good safety warning. This town's prepared now.

Behind him, in the background fog, a faint red-pulsing eye appears. One moment. Then it's gone.

EXT. CHURCH GROUNDS - DAY

A church event. Picnic tables. Nica's catered lunch. DOMINIC and DALLAS greet each other. They don't talk much. They sit next to each other. Eat. Still don't talk much.

In the distance: ASHER and MAKAYLA. They're crouched near the playground, watching something small. Makayla pulls a jar from her bag. A tiny caterpillar. She eases it inside. They're building little devices of their own—wires, batteries, scraps. This is just the start of the creature adventure. They don't say it. It's in the way they move.

Dallas watches them. He doesn't say anything.

INT. DALLAS'S WORKSHOP / HOUSE - DAY

Dallas at his desk. The tape recorder plays his late wife's voice. He fiddles with a recording mechanism. Wires. A modified receiver. He finally gets it working. He hits record. From outside, the hum from the tall grass bleeds into the room. He listens. He begins to sketch—notations, marks. An alphabet. Something to capture it.

INT. DALLAS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dallas goes to bed. The device sits on the nightstand. He hears echoes. Something beyond the shadows he saw before. He lies there. Listening.

EXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - MORNING

JANICE pulls up. She gets out. She and Dallas hug. She hands him HOWIE's leash. Dallas greets the little dog with real affection. They stare at each other for a while. Howie's ears twitch. He's disturbed by something out in the tall grass. Dallas looks at his watch. Then toward the creek.

EXT. CREEK BEND - DAY

The place where the lawn becomes reed. The same bend from before. Dallas stops. He lifts the receiver. He tunes the dial. The hum rises, falls. He adjusts again. The dial clicks into place. He stands there. Recording. The tall grass moves. He doesn't move. He listens.
