### Scene 1: Arrival & Discovery

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: arrival | File: 01_arrival.md*

---

INT. DALLAS' NEW HOUSE - DAY

Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving boxes and a few pieces of furniture.

He hears a noise from outside. Curious, he opens a box marked "EQUIPMENT."

Dallas pulls out a heavy, military-grade receiver. It's covered in dust. He peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.

The photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.

Dallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.

Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.

As he does this, he hears a HUM.

Dallas records readings, but the battery dies.

DALLAS
(to himself)
Damn.

He sets the receiver down and heads for the door.


---


### Scene 2: The Hum

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: 02_the-hum.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD STREET - DAY

Dallas walks into town for batteries. On the way, he meets his neighbor DOMINIC.

DOMINIC
Hey there! You're the new guy, right?

DALLAS
Yeah. Dallas.

DOMINIC
Dominic. Nice to meet you. Heading into town?

DALLAS
Just need batteries.

DOMINIC
I'll walk with you. Got some errands myself.

They walk together. As they approach the town center, Dallas notices a row of BIRDS perched on a power line. All facing the direction towards the marsh.

DALLAS
That's... unusual.

DOMINIC
What?

DALLAS
The birds. All facing the same direction.

DOMINIC
(shrugs)
Coastal birds. They do that.

But Dallas can't shake the feeling. Something's off.


---


### Scene 3: The Fellowship

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: fellowship | File: 03_fellowship.md*

---

EXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP HALL - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in a circle with other churchgoers outside, eating at the fellowship hall.

It's the last fellowship hall lunch of the summer. Late summer light filters through the trees.

DOMINIC
This is Sally's famous casserole. You gotta try it.

DALLAS
Thanks.

Dallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted, listening.

DOMINIC
So, what are you here for?

DALLAS
Work.

DOMINIC
At Yale?

DALLAS
Quinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.

DOMINIC
Nice. So are you here alone?

DALLAS
Yep.

DOMINIC
Okay cool. That's cool.

They finish eating. The group begins to disperse.

DOMINIC
Want to walk back together? I'll show you around.

DALLAS
Sure.

They start walking towards the marsh, towards the New England coast.

In the far distance, COYOTES HOWL.


---


### Scene 4: Parking Ticket

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: parking-ticket | File: 04_parking_ticket.md*

---

EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

Dallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.

DOMINIC
You have got to be kidding me! 

He rips the ticket off, waving it at the empty street.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)
Twelve minutes! I was gone twelve minutes. You see this, Dallas? This is where the taxes go. Not to fixing the potholes or the raccoon problem—oh no—it goes to the guy with the ticket book.

DALLAS
Raccoon problem?

DOMINIC
They’re everywhere. Knocking over bins, tearing up siding. Bold, too. They don’t even run anymore.

Dallas isn’t looking at the ticket. He’s looking up. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.

DALLAS
Dominic. Look at the birds.

Dominic glances up, then back at his ticket, uncaring.

DOMINIC
Probably waiting for a hand-out. Come on, let’s get your batteries before I get another fine for standing still.


---


### Scene 5: Marsh Walk

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk | File: 05_marsh_walk.md*

---

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

The sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds. 

Dominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app. 

DOMINIC
See this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.

Dallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.

DALLAS
I prefer the raw feed.

DOMINIC
Suit yourself. But there’s a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.

Dallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.


---


### Scene 6: News Vans

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: 06_news_vans.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD COMMON - CONTINUOUS

They reach the town green. Three news vans are parked haphazardly. PAT CLENDENEN, a local weatherman with an overly bright tie, adjusts his earpiece in front of a camera.

PAT CLENDENEN
(to camera)
...and while we’re all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday’s festival, but folks, get those generators ready!

Dominic scoffs as they walk past.

DOMINIC
Pat’s been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years. 

DALLAS
He mentioned the wind. It’s picking up.

The wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.


---


### Scene 7: Trash Cans

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: trash-cans | File: 07_trash_cans.md*

---

EXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - LATER

They arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere. 

DOMINIC
Those damn raccoons! I just put these out!

Dominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at his front door, then at Dallas.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)
Look, I gotta clean this up and get the furniture moved before the life group meeting tonight. The kids left the place a wreck. You mind helping me move the heavy sofa? I’ll buy you a beer.

DALLAS
(hesitates)
Sure. Just for a minute.


---


### Scene 8: The Coordinates

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-coordinates | File: 08_the_coordinates.md*

---

INT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The house smells like old wood and floor wax. Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall.

Dallas stops. On the wall is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy. 

DOMINIC
My wife and kid. They're... gone now. 

Dominic looks toward the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged fingernail.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)
I take care of him. He’s had a rough go since the weather changed.

Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a gnarled finger at the window.

MR. MIKE
[TODO: Mr. Mike dialogue]


---


### Scene 9: Janice Arrival

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: janice-arrival | File: 09_janice_arrival.md*

---

INT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

The front door slams open. JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. Behind her, ASHER (15) and MAKAYLA (22) trudge in, staring at their phones.

JANICE
(spitting out keys)
The traffic on I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why are you cooking the sprouts already? They’ll be mush by the time the group gets here.

DOMINIC
I’m following the recipe, Janice.

JANICE
(inspecting the pot)
You’re boiling them? You’re supposed to roast them! And the gravy—is that a lump? 

Janice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas’s heavy receiver on the floor.

JANICE (CONT'D)
What is this? A boat anchor?

DALLAS
It’s a receiver. For work.

Dominic ushers everyone toward the car for a quick errand. The kitchen is a whirlwind of coats, overlapping arguments, and the smell of scorched sprouts.


---


### Scene 10: Equipment Intro

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: equipment-intro | File: 10_equipment_intro.md*

---

INT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Makayla stops by Dallas's equipment. She doesn't look at it with Janice's annoyance; she looks with genuine curiosity.

MAKAYLA
This is military grade. What are you tracking? 

DALLAS
Bioacoustics. Sounds in the marsh.

MAKAYLA
Does it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung.

Asher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.

DOMINIC
(yelling from the door)
Everyone in the car! We’re going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!

The family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.


---


### Scene 11: Howie Walk

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: howie-walk | File: 11_howie_walk.md*

---

EXT. BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING

The Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the perimeter of his new property.

Dallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become.

DALLAS
(to himself)
What are you?

Howie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds. 

In the far distance, a single dog barks. Then another. A chain reaction of domestic fear starts in the neighborhood, followed by the high, thin yip of coyotes further inland.

Dallas pulls out his phone. A "Severe Weather Alert" pops up: STORM WARNING. 


---


### Scene 12: The First Hum

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-first-hum | File: 12_the_first_hum.md*

---

EXT. EDGE OF THE MARSH - CONTINUOUS

Everything goes still. The wind stops. The waves seem to mute themselves.

Then, the HUM begins. 

It starts as a vibration in Dallas's teeth, then moves to his chest. It is a deep, dense, multi-layered sound—a living reed being forced through a massive throat.

Dallas stands in a daze, his hand tightening on Howie’s leash. The tall grass doesn't just sway; it pulses in time with the sound.

DALLAS
(whispering)
That's not the wind.

Howie lets out a low, whimpering growl and tugs hard on the leash, pulling Dallas back toward the safety of the porch. 


---


### Scene 13: Shadows in Wind

*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: shadows-in-wind | File: 13_shadows_in_wind.md*

---

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.

Shadows—tall, spindly, and darker than the night—grow in the distance. They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships. 

He touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long, desperate. 

The hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames. 

In the darkness of the marsh, something stares back.

## ACT II — The Creature

### Scene 14: The Burn Mark

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-burn-mark | File: 14_the_burn_mark.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - DAWN

The morning air is thick with the scent of ozone. Janice’s minivan idles in the driveway. She drops Howie off, barely waving as she rushes toward the museum to secure artwork before the storm hits.

Makayla and Asher don't follow her. They wander toward the edge of Dallas’s property. 

MAKAYLA
Asher, look.

In the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal. 

Makayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.


---


### Scene 15: Costco Run

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: costco-run | File: 15_costco_run.md*

---

EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC
Life group tonight. Thanks for hosting. I’m heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries?

DALLAS
I’m good.

DOMINIC
Schools are canceled already. The kids are going to be underfoot all day. Try to keep ‘em out of the marsh, alright?

Dominic peels out. Dallas looks at the papers, then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.


---


### Scene 16: Entering Grass

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: entering-grass | File: 16_entering_grass.md*

---

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - DAY

Dallas walks the coastal trail with Howie. Suddenly, the air vibrates. A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds. 

Howie whines, pressing against Dallas’s leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.

His handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it’s a repeating, melodic pattern. 

DALLAS
(to Howie)
Stay here.

He ties Howie’s leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.


---


### Scene 17: The Hollow

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-hollow | File: 17_the_hollow.md*

---

EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves.

A cry rings out. It’s not a throat-sound; it’s air being forced through something hollow. 

Dallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.

A flickering glow emanates from its neck. Its "back-holes"—delicate vents along its spine—vibrate as it breathes, creating the sound that syncs perfectly with Dallas's receiver.


---


### Scene 18: Creature Rescue

*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-rescue | File: 18_creature_rescue.md*

---

EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The creature’s pulse is slowing. The glow in its neck dims. 

Dallas reaches out, his fingers trembling. As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.

He notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found. 

As Dallas lifts the fragile thing toward his chest, it lets out a faint, melodic whimper before fainting. The scope in his pocket goes silent. 

DALLAS
I've got you.

Suddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the ree
