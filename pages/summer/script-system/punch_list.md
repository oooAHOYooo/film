# Punch List: Script Polish
*Generated for recent updates to full script (s21, s22, s25, s26)*

## Typos & Grammar
- [ ] **s21.md**: Fix "grocies" to "groceries" (Scene 22 preview).
- [ ] **s25.md**: Fix "Makayla and Dalls" to "Makayla and Dallas".
- [ ] **s25.md**: Fix "errupting" to "erupting".
- [ ] **s25.md**: Fix "icnch" to "inch" in "Inch by icnch".
- [ ] **s25.md**: Fix "shouder" to "shoulder".
- [ ] **s26.md**: Fix "shadow climbing" metaphor if unclear (optional).
- [ ] **s26.md**: Fix sentence fragment: "while this happens their shadow tentacles hit".

## Formatting & Style
- [ ] **s21.md**: Remove `(action)` markers if they are not needed for strict formatting (the compiler handles them, but standard screenplays just use blank lines).
- [ ] **s21.md**: "SARAH, the vet" — Ensure Sarah is introduced in CAPS if this is her first appearance.
- [ ] **s21.md**: "DOMINIC appears..." — Ensure consistent capitalization for names in action lines.
- [ ] **s25.md**: Broken dialogue block at the end (Dallas and Makayla hold arms). Needs proper formatting or dialogue.
- [ ] **s26.md**: "Asher turn it on." — Should be dialogue? It's currently in a parenthetical/action mix.

## Consistency
- [ ] **s22.md**: Verify if "Sierra's folder" logic tracks with previous scenes (Makayla finding it).
- [ ] **s25.md**: "The creature's pulse is slowing" — Ensure this matches the timeline of it being healthy earlier.

## Creative Polish (New)
*Feedback integration for stronger stakes and emotional payoff.*

- [ ] **s22.md / s25.md (Ticking Clock)**: Reintroduce the battery readout/timer from s17. Have it hit "2 minutes" just before the predator attack to urge the pace.
- [ ] **s25.md / s26.md (Asher's Role)**: Make Asher a "human antenna" during the confrontation. Instead of just panic, have him guide Makayla's hand on the dial ("They're trying to sync").
- [ ] **s26.md (Final Gift)**: Add a beat where the creature touches the crystal, turning it from translucent to warm amber before leaving.
- [ ] **s26.md (Silence)**: Emphasize the *silence* when the device dies/predators cancel sound.
- [ ] **s29.md (News Van)**: Add a faint red-pulsing eye in the fog behind Pat Clendenen as a lingering threat.
- [ ] **s29.md (Ending Alphabet)**: Connect Dallas's new "Alphabet" sketch explicitly to Sierra's voice tape (he's finally talking back).

## Antigravity's Thoughts
*My analysis after reading the full script (s01–s29).*

- [ ] **s27.md (The Sound of Silence)**: The "Phase Inverter" trap is a great concept. To sell it visually/audibly, describe the *rain* or *storm noise* cutting out completely inside the corridor when it activates. Make the "silence" tactile.
- [ ] **s27.md (Asher's Agency)**: Currently, Asher has a panic attack (again). He should use his connection to *direct* the trap. Instead of "Run," maybe he points and says "Left... 30 degrees..." guiding Dallas. Make his curse a weapon.
- [ ] **s24.md (Urgency)**: The decision to return to the marsh happens fast. Emphasize the burn marks *spreading* or pulsing on their arms to make the "we have to go back" decision feel like a medical necessity, not just a hero choice.
- [ ] **s27.md (Formatting)**: There is a trailing "They " on line 9 that needs deletion or completion.

## Next Steps
- Pick a block, fix the file, run `node compile-all.js`.
