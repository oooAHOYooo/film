## MR. MIKE

### 06_the_coordinates.md

**After:** Dominic’s line *"He doesn't like it at all."* (around line 37)  
**Add (behavior / subtext):** Mr. Mike’s agitation isn’t only “weather” — the storm is lowering pressure and expanding the acoustic range of the marsh. He’s been tuned to 115.3 for decades; the change makes his internal signal louder. *LORE: “The dementia isn’t just age — the residual frequency has been degrading his cognition… He’s tuned to a channel nobody else can hear.”*

**After:** Mr. Mike points at the window, *"She's here!"* (around line 41)  
**Add (direction / beat):** His “she” could read as the pressure shift or a presence he’s always half-hearing — the same frequency Elena chased. *LORE: “Mr. Mike and Elena never met, but they heard the same signal — 40 years apart, on the same frequency. 115.3 MHz.”*

**After:** Dallas catches the numbers, Dominic flips the table (around line 49)  
**Add (action or Dallas POV):** The numbers aren’t nonsense — they’re bearings/coordinates. Mr. Mike has been mapping creature movement in a language no one recognized. *LORE: “His scratching of numbers and coordinates isn’t random — it’s data. He’s been mapping the creatures’ movements for years.”*

**After:** Asher walks over to Mr. Mike to see how he is doing (line 101)  
**Add (Asher / Mr. Mike beat):** Asher is the one who’s often near him; a moment where Mr. Mike grips his wrist or taps a number into Asher’s palm — not explained, just shown. *LORE: Mr. Mike as “the most attuned” — he knows when Eaters are near before anyone else.*

---

### 08_dallas_home_night.md

**After:** *"The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood."* (line 23)  
**Add (Dallas realization):** Dallas is not just decoding — he’s reading a map that’s been written in front of everyone for years. *LORE: “He’s been carrying it in his body ever since… 115.3 MHz.”* Optional: a single beat where Dallas wonders how long Mr. Mike has been hearing this.

---

### 20_basement_huddle.md

**After:** Mr. Mike *"It’s down there! Under the floor! They’re coming for it!"* (lines 5–7)  
**Add (direction):** He’s not raving — he feels the Eaters’ approach (silence-radius, pressure change) before the others. *LORE: “He knows when the Eaters are near before anyone else. He can feel pressure changes that correspond to creature activity.”*

**Optional:** A beat where Mr. Mike goes still or his chanting shifts when something crosses the property — no dialogue, just behavior that pays off his “attuned” role.

---

### 28_final_echoes.md

**After:** *"Mr. Mike rocks back and forth, his voice a rhythmic chant."* (line 5)  
**Add (sound / detail):** His *"One-one-five point three"* is the frequency he’s carried since the 1970s — the same one Dallas is about to lock onto. *LORE: “The numbers he scratches — 115.3 MHz — that’s the frequency he heard. He’s been carrying it in his body ever since.”*

**Optional:** When Dallas later finds the dial (if that beat is in this or an adjacent scene), a cut or beat to Mr. Mike — he doesn’t need to react; his presence is enough to imply he’s been the third human (with Elena and soon Dallas) to hear it clearly.

---

## MAKAYLA

### 01_arrival.md

**After:** Makayla asks to borrow the Oscillator for Asher, *"He and his friends are hunting for evidence around the marsh"* (line 26)  
**Add (character note / direction):** She’s the one who’s curious and fearless — “clean signal,” no grief yet. *LORE: “Before the grass: Fearless, curious, unfiltered. No grief, no baggage, clean signal.”* Optional: a small beat where she’s already listening (glance at the grass, tilt of head) without saying why.

---

### 06_the_coordinates.md

**After:** *"Like a vibrating lung"* (line 105)  
**Add (direction or one line):** She’s not guessing — she’s reporting what she heard. Her body is already a good conductor. *LORE: “Her body doesn’t resist the frequency; it harmonizes with it.”* You could add a single action: she touches her chest or ear as she says it, as if feeling it again.

---

### 13_entering_grass.md & 16_the_escape.md (crystal discovery)

**After:** *"Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone."* (15: line 12; 18: line 13)  
**Add (direction):** The crystal isn’t just static — it’s testing her resonance. She “passes”; that’s why the creature’s glow will later brighten at her touch. *LORE: “The crystal’s frequency is testing her resonance. She passes… She’s a natural conductor.”*

**After:** *"She quickly pockets it"*  
**Add (behavior):** She doesn’t treat it like a rock — she holds it a moment, or keeps a hand near her pocket. *LORE: Crystals as “fossilized sound,” waypoints. She’s picked up a waypoint; she doesn’t know it yet.*

---

### 18_entering_grass.md (115.3 / creature stabilizes)

**After:** Dallas adjusts to 115.3 and the creature stabilizes (around line 25)  
**Add (Makayla beat):** She’s the one who doesn’t need recalibration — she was already open. A look or small reaction that she *feels* the shift when the creature locks in. *LORE: “Makayla doesn’t change the way Dallas does. She doesn’t need recalibration — she was already open.”*

---

### 20_basement_huddle.md

**After:** *"Makayla slips past them, her eyes catching Dallas’s. She knows."* (line 21)  
**Add (direction):** She’s not just “knowing” plot — she’s feeling the creature. By Act II she’s moving from curious to protective. *LORE: “She goes from curious to protective to active… She can feel the creature dying. Not hear it. Feel it. The frequency is in her bones.”*

---

### 21_the_hymn.md

**After:** Crystal glows brighter, Makayla’s hair lifts (lines 9–10)  
**Add (direction):** The crystal and the creature are in harmony; she’s the bridge. The creature’s glow brightens at her touch because she’s a conductor. *LORE: “This is why the creature’s glow brightens at her touch. She’s a natural conductor.”*

**Optional:** A beat where she places the sugar cube or touches the creature — not dialogue, just the idea that she’s *participating* in the chord, like the hymn upstairs.

---

### 25_predator_attack.md

**After:** Dallas and Makayla freeze, paralyzed by the hum (line 7)  
**Add (direction):** She’s not just following Dallas here — she’s leading. She sprinted into the grass because she felt the creature dying. *LORE: “By Act III she’s not following Dallas — she’s leading. She sprints into the grass because she can feel the creature dying. Not hear it. Feel it.”*

**After:** *"guided by the flickering glow of the crystal in Makayla’s pocket"* (line 3)  
**Add (detail):** The crystal is a waypoint — it’s lighting up in response to the creature network. *LORE: “The crystals are how the creatures navigate: they leave tonal breadcrumbs.”*

---

### 28_final_echoes.md

**After:** *"Makayla rattles in her chair"* (line 5)  
**Add (direction):** The house is full of pressure and fear; she’s the one most tuned to the creature’s distress. Her “snap” isn’t panic — it’s purpose. *LORE: “The frequency is in her bones.”*

**If you add an Act IV beat (new scene or extension):** Makayla with a caterpillar in a jar — she’s not just collecting. She’s listening. Checking if it hums. *LORE: “She puts it in a jar not because she’s collecting bugs. She’s listening to it. She’s checking if it hums. She’ll spend the rest of her life testing the world for hidden frequencies.”*

---

## ASHER

### 01_arrival.md

**After:** *"Asher stands silent in a sheepish shyness"* (line 36)  
**Add (direction):** He’s the one who notices things and doesn’t speak up — the kid who will later process what he sees through drawing. *LORE: “Before: Quiet. Watchful. The kid who notices things but doesn’t speak up.”*

---

### 06_the_coordinates.md

**After:** *"Asher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes… The leaves ripple, though there is no wind."* (lines 107–108)  
**Add (direction):** He’s not spacing out — he’s tracking movement. After he sees the creatures, this will turn into drawing. *LORE: “After: He draws. Constantly… He’s not remembering — he’s receiving. The frequency left an imprint and it’s expressing itself through his hands.”* Optional: a beat where his hand moves as if sketching in the air or against his leg.

---

### 11_howie_walk.md

**After:** *"Dallas and Asher make eye contact and Dallas looks the other way"* (line 40)  
**Add (direction):** Asher is the one who’s been at the window, who’s seen the grass move. He and Dallas share something unsaid — they’re both listening. *LORE: Asher as observer; later his sketches become “increasingly accurate, increasingly detailed.”* Optional: Asher has a sketchbook under his arm or in his pocket — no callout, just present.

---

### 21_the_hymn.md

**After:** Asher’s *"Is it... talking to us?"* (line 9)  
**Add (direction):** He processes through seeing and doing — the question is genuine. Soon he’ll process the creatures through drawing. *LORE: “He doesn’t talk about what he saw — he processes it visually.”*

---

### 23_creature_missing.md / 24_marsh_confrontation.md

**After:** Asher points to the burn marks on the siding (26: line 11)  
**Add (direction):** He’s the one who sees the trail — the observer. His eye for pattern will later show up in his drawings (e.g. burn marks as shapes). *LORE: “His sketches are increasingly accurate… He’s not remembering — he’s receiving.”* Optional: a beat where he’s already mentally “drawing” the path — stillness, focus.

---

### 27_the_last_dinner.md

**After:** *"Asher! The wire!"* — Asher helping with the perimeter (lines 3–7)  
**Add (direction):** He’s not just following orders — he’s the one who notices details, who can run wire in a pattern. Same skill set that makes his drawings precise. *LORE: Asher channels the frequency “inward (observation, art, stillness).”*

---

### 28_final_echoes.md

**After:** *"Dominic and Asher have cooked a silent meal"* (line 3)  
**Add (direction):** The silence isn’t empty for Asher — he’s full of what he’s seen. He might have a sketchbook nearby or catch himself drawing on the tablecloth. *LORE: “Two siblings, same exposure, different instruments” — Makayla runs into the grass, Asher draws.*

---

## CROSS‑CHARACTER / SHARED LORE

- **Crystals:** Any time a crystal appears (14, 17, 22, 26), you can add a single line of direction that they’re “fossilized sound,” waypoints, or that they react to the creature network. No dialogue needed.
- **115.3 MHz:** Whenever it’s mentioned or dialed (08, 19, 29, Mr. Mike’s chant), it’s the same frequency Elena chased, Mr. Mike carries, and Dallas will finally lock onto — the “third human to hear it clearly.”
- **Chord vs. solo:** Where relevant, you can imply that the hymn (21) or the group in the basement is “participating in the chord” — harmony as protection — without stating it. *LORE: “Humans can participate in the chord… The hymn at life group amplifies the Singers’ frequency.”*
- **Burn marks:** In 13, 25, or wherever Janice’s van or the house siding are shown — direction that the marks are “scorch marks from silence” or that they’re shaped like the creatures (sealed back-holes). *LORE: “The burn marks are shaped like the creatures… the outline of a sealed back-hole.”*

## SCENES WITH NO DIRECT MAKAYLA / MR. MIKE / ASHER BEATS

These scenes don’t feature the three, but lore can still inform **direction** or **sound** for Dallas/Howie/creatures:

- **02_dallas-night.md, 03_the-hum.md, 04_marsh_walk.md, 07_dallas_marsh_walk.md:** Storm lowering pressure; marsh as waveguide; grass as body of the creatures.
- **09/11 Howie:** Howie has always heard the Singers; his anxiety is overstimulation; when Eaters are near, he goes “listening-still.” *LORE: “Dogs hear 40–60 kHz. Howie has always heard the Singers.”*
- **14_creature_rescue.md, 15_the_burn_mark.md:** Injured creature “cut off from the chord”; second crystal as waypoint; Eaters creating silence.

Use this guide to drop in **action lines, parentheticals, or single character directions** that carry the lore through Makayla, Mr. Mike, and Asher without changing your existing dialogue or plot.
