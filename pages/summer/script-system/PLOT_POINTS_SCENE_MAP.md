- **1. Dallas finds the creature** → **s08** `s08.md`
- **2. Makayla discovers Dallas has it** → **s13** `s13.md` (with **s12** folded into it)
- **3. Lifegroup meeting** → **s19–s21** (`s19.md`, `s20.md`, `s21.md`)
- **4. Creature escapes** → **s23** `s23.md` (seed Red Eyes in **s22**)

## Alignment checklist (quick validation)

- [ ] **1** Dallas finds the creature on-screen and danger is immediate (not just “he picked it up”).
- [ ] **2** Makayla’s discovery creates a new problem (shared secret + consequences).
- [ ] **3** Lifegroup = public normality colliding with the hum; ends with a decision to return it.
- [ ] **4** Escape is causal/unavoidable (not random) and changes the rules.
- [ ] **5** Creature death is felt and matters mechanically later.
- [ ] **6** Makayla + Dallas choose to go (active choice with clear stakes).
- [ ] **7** First dark-creature confrontation includes distinctive weird marks (recognizable later).
- [ ] **8** Retreat includes explicit dread: “they’ll come for us” (Dominic voice).
- [ ] **9** Shadows at the edge triggers Mr Mike + Asher “zap episodes” (proves it’s not weather).
- [ ] **10** Plan is spoken plainly: what it is, why it works, what could fail.
- [ ] **11** They set out with the plan (not an accident) and the plan gets pressure-tested.
- [ ] **12** Climax has clear swings (who’s winning/losing) with light vs shadow logic.
- [ ] **13** Resolution is unexpected and tied to earlier setups (Sierra folder, grid draw, crystal, corridor).
- [ ] **14** Aftermath restores normalcy while showing legacy/science continues.


## 2.17.26 UPDATES

To add the Vision/Mother arc and the Reverse Device mission into your script in 5-minute blocks, focus on these specific "insertion points."

Since you have limited time, don't rewrite the whole script. Just drop these "beats" into the existing scenes.

Block 1: The "Touch" and The Vision (Scene 13/14 transition)
Location: When they first examine the creature in the kitchen.

The Tweak: As Makayla reaches out to soothe the creature, her hand brushes its wing.

Action: Add 3–4 lines of description: The golden light flares. The kitchen sounds drop out, replaced by a soft, familiar humming—a lullaby. Makayla sees a woman’s silhouette in the tall grass. It’s her mother. The woman turns, smiles, and whispers: "Listen to the spaces between the notes."

Result: Makayla pulls back, gasping. She now has a personal stake.

Block 2: Establishing the Plan (Scene 15 - The Lair)
Location: Before the LifeGroup guests arrive.

The Tweak: Makayla tells Dallas about the vision. She realizes her mother was tracking these same frequencies.

Action: Makayla pulls out her "Small Jammer." Dallas holds the Crystal next to it.

Dialogue: > DALLAS: "Your mom wasn't just watching them. She was protecting them. We can use this crystal to invert my Oscillator. Create a shield."

MAKAYLA: "We have to test it at the Creek Bend. That's the source."

Result: The "Reverse Device" mission is born.

Block 3: The Technical Prep (Scene 15 - Assembly)
Location: Minutes before the first LifeGroup doorbell rings.

The Tweak: Dallas uses the numbers Mr. Mike scratched into the table to calibrate the device.

Action: Describe Dallas turning the dials—45 Left, 15 Right. The Oscillator emits a low, protective hum that stabilizes the flickering kitchen lights.

Visual: Dallas straps the Oscillator into a shoulder rig, the Crystal glowing at the center.

Result: The device is now a "character" in the story.

Block 4: The Asher Trance (Scene 16 - Pre-Departure)
Location: Just as the LifeGroup starts in the next room.

The Tweak: Asher touches the Crystal or the Device.

Action: Asher’s eyes go distant. He repeats the exact words from Makayla’s vision: "The light doesn't leave. It just changes frequency."

Result: This confirms the vision was real and raises the stakes—they have to get to the marsh to "bring Asher back."

Block 5: The Stealth Departure (Scene 17)
Location: Squeezing through the mudroom while the LifeGroup is praying.

The Tweak: Make them look like a "Tactical Science Team."

Action: They aren't just running; they are checking the Reverse Device monitors.

Dialogue: > MAKAYLA: "The Shadows are peaking at the creek. We have ten minutes before the device burns out."

Result: The walk to the marsh is now a "ticking clock" mission.

Block 6: The Ending "Gift" (The Final Scene)
Location: At the Creek Bend after the Shadows are repelled.

The Tweak: The hand-off.

Action: The creature doesn't just fly away. It lands in front of Makayla. It touches the Crystal, and the stone turns from a "battery" into a deep, glowing amber.

Result: The creature gives the Crystal to her. It’s the "Memory Stone."

Summary Checklist for your Morning:
[ ] 5 mins: Write the "Mother's Vision" description (Scene 13).

[ ] 5 mins: Add the "Reverse Device" dialogue in the Lair (Scene 15).

[ ] 5 mins: Insert the "Asher repeats the Mother's words" beat (Scene 16).

[ ] 5 mins: Add the "10-minute countdown" dialogue to the stealth exit.

[ ] 5 mins: Rewrite the final beat where the creature gives the Crystal to Makayla.

The Rating: This turns your script into a "High-Concept Emotional Sci-Fi." It feels like Contact—where the technology is just a way for humans to process their grief.
