DALLAS' NEW HOUSE - DAY\n\nDallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving boxes and a few pieces of furniture.\n\nHe hears a noise from outside. Curious, he opens a box marked \"EQUIPMENT.\"\n\nDallas pulls out a heavy, military-grade receiver. It's covered in dust. He peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.\n\nThe photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.\n\nDallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.\n\nDallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.\n\nAs he does this, he hears a HUM.\n\nDallas records readings, but the battery dies.\n\nDALLAS\n\n(to himself)\n\nDamn.\n\nHe sets the receiver down and heads for the door.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 2: The Hum\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: 02_the-hum.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. BRANFORD STREET - DAY\n\nDallas walks into town for batteries. On the way, he meets his neighbor DOMINIC.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nHey there! You're new guy, right?\n\nDALLAS\n\nYeah. Dallas.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nDominic. Nice to meet you. Heading into town?\n\nDALLAS\n\nJust need batteries.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nI'll walk with you. Got some errands myself.\n\nThey walk together. As they approach the town center, Dallas notices a row of BIRDS perched on a power line. All facing the direction towards the marsh.\n\nDALLAS\n\nThat's... unusual.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nWhat?\n\nDALLAS\n\nThe birds. All facing the same direction.\n\nDOMINIC\n\n(shrugs)\n\nCoastal birds. They do that.\n\nBut Dallas can't shake the feeling. Something's off.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 3: The Fellowship\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: fellowship | File: 03_fellowship.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP HALL - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nDallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in a circle with other churchgoers outside, eating at the fellowship hall.\n\nIt's the last fellowship hall lunch of the summer. Late summer light filters through the trees.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nThis is Sally's famous casserole. You gotta try it.\n\nDALLAS\n\nThanks.\n\nDallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted, listening.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nSo, what are you here for?\n\nDALLAS\n\nWork.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nAt Yale?\n\nDALLAS\n\nQuinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nWhat kind of work?\n\nDALLAS\n\nBioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh—birds, insects, coyotes. I start next semester.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nNice. So are you here alone?\n\nDALLAS\n\nYep.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nOkay cool. That's cool.\n\nThey finish eating. The group begins to disperse.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nWant to walk back together? I'll show you around.\n\nDALLAS\n\nSure.\n\nThey start walking towards the marsh, towards the New England coast.\n\nIn the far distance, COYOTES HOWL.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 4: Parking Ticket\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: parking-ticket | File: 04_parking_ticket.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY\n\nDallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nYou have got to be kidding me!\n\nHe rips the ticket off, waving it at the empty street.\n\nDOMINIC (CONT'D)\n\nTwelve minutes! I was over twelve minutes. You see this, Dallas? This is where the taxes go. Not to fixing the potholes or the raccoon problem—oh no—it goes to the guy with the ticket book.\n\nDALLAS\n\nRaccoon problem?\n\nDOMINIC\n\nThey’re everywhere. Knocking over bins, tearing up siding. Bold, too. They don’t even run anymore.\n\nDallas isn’t looking at the ticket. He’s looking up. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.\n\nDALLAS\n\nDominic. Look at the birds.\n\nDominic glances up, then back at his ticket, uncaring.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nProbably waiting for a hand-out. Come on, let’s get your batteries before I get another fine for standing still.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 5: Marsh Walk\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk | File: 05_marsh_walk.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER\n\nThe sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.\n\nDominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nSee this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.\n\nDallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.\n\nDALLAS\n\nI prefer the raw feed.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nSuit yourself. But there’s a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.\n\nDallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 6: News Vans\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: 06_news_vans.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. BRANFORD COMMON - CONTINUOUS\n\nThey reach the town green. Three news vans are parked haphazardly. PAT CLENDENEN, a local weatherman with an overly bright tie, adjusts his earpiece in front of a camera.\n\nPAT CLENDENEN\n\n(to camera)\n\n...and while we’re all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday’s festival, but folks, get those generators ready!\n\nDominic scoffs as they walk past.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nPat’s been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.\n\nDALLAS\n\nHe mentioned the wind. It’s picking up.\n\nThe wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 7: Trash Cans\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: trash-cans | File: 07_trash_cans.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - LATER\n\nThey arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nThose damn raccoons! I just put these out!\n\nDominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at his front door, then at Dallas.\n\nDOMINIC (CONT'D)\n\nLook, I gotta clean this up and get the furniture moved before the life group meeting tonight. The kids left the place a wreck. You mind helping me move the heavy sofa? I’ll buy you a beer.\n\nDALLAS\n\n(hesitates)\n\nSure. Just for a minute.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 8: The Coordinates\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-coordinates | File: 08_the_coordinates.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe house smells like old wood and floor wax. Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall.\n\nDallas stops. On the wall is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nMy wife and kid. They're... gone now.\n\nDominic looks toward the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged fingernail.\n\nDOMINIC (CONT'D)\n\nI take care of him. He’s had a rough go since the weather changed.\n\nDominic moves to the window and shuts the blinds halfway, like he’s done it a thousand times.\n\nMr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a gnarled finger at the window.\n\nMR. MIKE\n\nShe's here.\n\nDominic is already moving—trying to calm him, trying to stop him.\n\nMr. Mike scratches faster. Dallas leans in and catches the numbers before Dominic blocks his view.\n\nMR. MIKE (CONT'D)\n\nForty-five left. Fifteen right.\n\nDallas freezes. Dominic flips the end table over—the scratchpad numbers disappear against the floorboards.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 9: Janice Arrival\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: janice-arrival | File: 09_janice_arrival.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nThe front door slams open. JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. Behind her, ASHER (15) and MAKAYLA (22) trudge in, staring at their phones.\n\nJANICE\n\n(spitting out keys)\n\nThe traffic on I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why are you cooking the sprouts already? They’ll be mush by the time the group gets here.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nI’m following the recipe, Janice.\n\nJANICE\n\n(inspecting the pot)\n\nYou’re boiling them? You’re supposed to roast them! And the gravy—is that a lump?\n\nJanice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas’s heavy receiver on the floor.\n\nJANICE (CONT'D)\n\nWhat is this? A boat anchor?\n\nDALLAS\n\nIt’s a receiver. For work.\n\nDominic ushers everyone toward the car for a quick errand. The kitchen is a whirlwind of coats, overlapping arguments, and the smell of scorched sprouts.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 10: Equipment Intro\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: equipment-intro | File: 10_equipment_intro.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\n\nMakayla stops by Dallas's equipment. She doesn't look at it with Janice's annoyance; she looks with genuine curiosity.\n\nMAKAYLA\n\nThis is military grade. What are you tracking?\n\nDALLAS\n\nBioacoustics. Sounds in the marsh.\n\nMAKAYLA\n\nDoes it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung.\n\nAsher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.\n\nDOMINIC\n\n(yelling from the door)\n\nEveryone in the car! We’re going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!\n\nThe family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 11: Howie Walk\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: howie-walk | File: 11_howie_walk.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING\n\nThe Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the perimeter of his new property.\n\nDallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become.\n\nDALLAS\n\n(to himself)\n\nWhat are you?\n\nHowie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.\n\nIn the far distance, a single dog barks. Then another. A chain reaction of domestic fear starts in the neighborhood, followed by the high, thin yip of coyotes further inland.\n\nDallas pulls out his phone. A \"Severe Weather Alert\" pops up: STORM WARNING.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 12: The First Hum\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-first-hum | File: 12_the_first_hum.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. EDGE OF THE MARSH - CONTINUOUS\n\nEverything goes still. The wind stops. The waves seem to mute themselves.\n\nThen, the HUM begins.\n\nIt starts as a vibration in Dallas's teeth, then moves to his chest. It is a deep, dense, multi-layered sound—a living reed being forced through a massive throat.\n\nDallas stands in a daze, his hand tightening on Howie’s leash. The tall grass doesn't just sway; it pulses in time with the sound.\n\nDALLAS\n\n(whispering)\n\nThat's not the wind.\n\nHowie lets out a low, whimpering growl and tugs hard on the leash, pulling Dallas back toward the safety of the porch.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 13: Shadows in Wind\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: shadows-in-wind | File: 13_shadows_in_wind.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS' HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nDallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.\n\nShadows—tall, spindly, and darker than the night—grow in the distance. They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships.\n\nHe touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long, desperate.\n\nThe hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames.\n\nIn the darkness of the marsh, something stares back.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## ACT II — The Creature\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 14: The Burn Mark\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-burn-mark | File: 14_the_burn_mark.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - DAWN\n\nThe morning air is thick with the scent of ozone. Janice’s minivan idles in the driveway. She drops Howie off, barely waving as she rushes toward the museum to secure artwork before the storm hits.\n\nMakayla and Asher don't follow her. They wander toward the edge of Dallas’s property.\n\nMAKAYLA\n\nAsher, look.\n\nIn the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.\n\nMakayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 15: Costco Run\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: costco-run | File: 15_costco_run.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS\n\nDominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nLife group tonight. Thanks for hosting. I’m heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries?\n\nDALLAS\n\nI’m good.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nSchools are canceled already. The kids are going to be underfoot all day. Try to keep ‘em out of the marsh, alright?\n\nDominic peels out. Dallas looks at the papers, then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 16: Entering Grass\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: entering-grass | File: 16_entering_grass.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - DAY\n\nDallas walks the coastal trail with Howie. Suddenly, the air vibrates. A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds.\n\nHowie whines, pressing against Dallas’s leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.\n\nHis handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it’s a repeating, melodic pattern.\n\nDALLAS\n\n(to Howie)\n\nStay here.\n\nHe ties Howie’s leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 17: The Hollow\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-hollow | File: 17_the_hollow.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves.\n\nA cry rings out. It’s not a throat-sound; it’s air being forced through something hollow.\n\nDallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.\n\nA flickering glow emanates from its neck. Its \"back-holes\"—delicate vents along its spine—vibrate as it breathes, creating the sound that syncs perfectly with Dallas's receiver.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 18: Creature Rescue\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-rescue | File: 18_creature_rescue.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe creature’s pulse is slowing. The glow in its neck dims.\n\nDallas reaches out, his fingers trembling. As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.\n\nHe notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.\n\nAs Dallas lifts the fragile thing toward his chest, it lets out a faint, melodic whimper before fainting. The scope in his pocket goes silent.\n\nDALLAS\n\nI've got you.\n\nSuddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the ree\n\n[TODO: finish this beat / complete last line]\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 19: The Escape\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-escape | File: 19_the_escape.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. TALL GRASS - CONTINUOUS\n\nDallas clutches the creature to his chest, its downy fur damp against his coat. The sound in the grass isn't just wind—it’s a wake. Something heavy is slicing through the reeds, rocketing toward him like an arrow.\n\nDALLAS\n\n(to himself)\n\nGo, go, go.\n\nHe breaks into a sprint, stumbling over hidden roots. He reaches the cedar tree. Howie is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass. Dallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is a hundred yards behind them.\n\nHe stops at the edge of his driveway, gasping for air. He looks down at his coat. The creature is motionless, but its neck glow pulses a weak, fading amber.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 20: Makeshift Hospital\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: makeshift-hospital | File: 20_makeshift_hospital.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - LATER\n\nDallas has turned his kitchen island into a triage station. He’s wired a portable oscilloscope to the creature’s head using tiny alligator clips.\n\nThe device pulses in a rhythmic, green jagged line—perfectly in sync with the creature's heartbeat.\n\nDALLAS\n\n(whispering)\n\nStay with me.\n\nHe adjusts the dial on his military receiver to a 115.3 MHz frequency. The creature’s breathing stabilizes. It lets out a low, melodic tone through its back-holes.\n\nHowie sits in the corner, head cocked, shivering. Outside, the world responds: the windows rattle, and a deep, distant hum echoes from the town center.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 21: Life Group Arrives\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: life-group-arrives | File: 21_life_group_arrives.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING\n\nDominic returns with arms full of Costco boxes. He’s followed by Mr. Mike, who is already muttering and pointing at the basement door.\n\nMR. MIKE\n\nIt’s down there! Under the floor! They’re coming for it!\n\nDominic ignores him, greeting the first family to arrive: JOSH and SARAH, holding their newborn, JP.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nDallas! You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.\n\nDALLAS\n\n(distracted)\n\nJust... the weather.\n\nMakayla slips past them, her eyes catching Dallas’s. She knows.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 22: Basement Huddle\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: basement-huddle | File: 22_basement_huddle.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER\n\nDallas has moved the creature to a shoebox lined with one of his wife’s old sweatshirts. Makayla and Asher crouch beside it.\n\nMAKAYLA\n\nIt’s beautiful.\n\nShe pulls the sugar cube from her pocket and places it near the creature’s mouth. She takes out her crystal; as it nears the creature, the crystal glows brighter, and Makayla’s hair begins to lift in the static.\n\nASHER\n\nIs it... talking to us?\n\nDALLAS\n\nIt’s vibrating. It’s operating on a different timeline.\n\nA floorboard creaks above. The \"Life Group\" is growing. They can hear the muffled sounds of small talk and chairs scraping.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 23: The Hymn\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-hymn | File: 23_the_hymn.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT\n\nThe house is packed. Families sit on folding chairs, eating Dominic’s Brussels sprouts. TYLER, a young man with a guitar, hands out music sheets.\n\nTYLER\n\nLet’s start with something to settle the nerves. The storm’s close.\n\nThey begin to sing a hymn. As the twenty voices rise in harmony, the hum from the basement begins to harmonize with them. It’s subtle at first, then undeniable.\n\nThe floorboards begin to vibrate. The guests look around, confused.\n\nPAT CLENDENEN\n\n(the weatherman)\n\nMust be the wind hitting the eaves. Pressure's dropping fast.\n\nBut Dallas is staring at the basement door. The sound isn't the wind. It’s an answer.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 24: Red Eyes\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: red-eyes | File: 24_red_eyes.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\n\nThe Life Group has departed, leaving the house in a hollow silence. Dallas stands by the tall window, staring into the dark.\n\nHe looks at his monitor—a grainy video feed of the creature in the basement. It’s breathing, but the frequency of the room is shifting.\n\nDallas looks out toward the tall grass. A pair of bright, dim-red eyes emerge in the distance. He blinks, looking at the telephone pole—a red light. A car in the distance—a red light.\n\nHe returns his gaze to the grass. The red eyes are gone. Then, they reappear, swirling through the blades, inching closer to the house. Pulses of red light flicker like a predatory heartbeat.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 25: Creature Missing\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-missing | File: 25_creature_missing.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER\n\nDallas rushes downstairs, Howie whimpering at his heels. He reaches the shoebox. It’s empty.\n\nThe window above is unlatched, swinging in the rising wind. Outside, Janice is staring at her minivan, which is covered in strange, scorched patterns.\n\nJANICE\n\nDallas! What is happening to my car?\n\nAsher points to the siding of the house. A trail of burn marks leads from the basement window toward the marsh. The creature is gone, and the \"bad things\" are calling it back.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## ACT III — The Return\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 26: Marsh Confrontation\n\n*ACT III — The Return | ID: marsh-confrontation | File: 26_marsh_confrontation.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. SALT MARSH - NIGHT\n\nDallas and Makayla trek through the reeds, guided by the flickering glow of the crystal in Makayla’s pocket.\n\nThey find the injured creature. It is surrounded by others of its kind—smaller, birdlike elders waving their hands.\n\nSuddenly, a mist sprays from the elders' backs. Dallas and Makayla freeze, their bodies paralyzed by the hum. Dozens of golden lights rise like lanterns in the mist, but from the shadows, the red eyes emerge, circling the light.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 27: Predator Attack\n\n*ACT III — The Return | ID: predator-attack | File: 27_predator_attack.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. SALT MARSH - CONTINUOUS\n\nThe predators pounce. In a blur of shadow and gnashing sound, the red eyes snatch the golden lights one by one.\n\nDallas fights the paralysis. He reaches for his frequency dial. He turns it hard—the tiny creature pulses with a blinding light, causing the predators to retract for a split second.\n\nHe grabs the creature, but as he pulls it close, the pulsing stops. It’s motionless. The bass scale of the hum drops to a terrifying low. They have to run.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 28: The Perimeter\n\n*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-perimeter | File: 28_the_perimeter.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - NIGHT (STORM)\n\nThe storm hits. Dallas, Dominic, and Asher are in the yard, battling the wind. Dallas jams heavy metal poles into the mud at ten-foot intervals.\n\nDALLAS\n\nAsher! The wire!\n\nThey string heavy copper wire between the poles, creating a makeshift Faraday fence. Dallas connects his military receiver to the circuit. As he powers it on, the orange indicator light turns green. The perimeter is live.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 29: The Last Dinner\n\n*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-last-dinner | File: 29_the_last_dinner.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - NIGHT\n\nThe crew sits at the table in the vibrating house. Dominic and Asher have cooked a silent meal. They eat with their eyes on the windows.\n\nThe sound of sniffs and gnarls echoes from the porch. Makayla rattles in her chair. In the corner, Mr. Mike rocks back and forth, his voice a rhythmic chant.\n\nMR. MIKE\n\nOne-one-five point three. One-one-five point three.\n\nSuddenly, Makayla snaps. She runs out the door, straight into the tall grass. Dominic and Dallas scramble after her, disappearing into the screaming wind.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## ACT IV — Aftermath\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 30: Final Echoes\n\n*ACT IV — Aftermath | ID: final-echoes | File: 30_final_echoes.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - MORNING\n\nThe sun rises over a quiet Branford. The storm has passed. On the news, Pat Clendenen calls the weather shift a \"miracle\".\n\nDallas sits on his porch with Howie.
