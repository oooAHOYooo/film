DALLAS NEW HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas stares at the Tall Grass outside his house as he loads boxes. He waves to DOMINIC and JANICE and the KIDS as they drive from the street. \r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas struggles to fall asleep in his new home. He hears strange noises from outside. As he looks out the window he sees a flicker of a faint gold light. \r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS' NEW HOUSE - NEXT DAY\r\n\r\nDallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving supplies and a few pieces of furniture.\r\n\r\nHe hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers outside. Curious, he opens a box marked \"EQUIPMENT.\"\r\n\r\nDallas pulls out a heavy, military-grade desktop Oscillator, a portable audio recorder, an a portable Oscillator. In the bottom of the box, covered in dust, sumberged by cables,  Dallas finds and old pair of retro red headphones. \r\n\r\nOn one of the headphones, Dallas peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.\r\n\r\nThe photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.\r\n\r\nDallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.\r\n\r\nDallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.\r\n\r\nAs he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside.\r\n\r\nDallas walks to the window and attempts to record the readings, and just as it capturing something, the battery dies.  \r\n\r\nHe sets the receiver down and heads for the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 2: The Hum\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: 02_the-hum.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. DALLAS HOUSE - DAY\r\nDallas walks outside.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. BRANFORD STREET - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas walks into town. On the way, he meets his neighbor DOMINIC.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNeighbor!\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat's that?\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou are my neighbor - we saw you the other day driving by - did you just move here?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nOh - yeah.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNice. Names Dominic.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nDallas, what a cool name - - What you doing?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nI'm just walking into town - got to get some batteries.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat kind of batteries?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n9 Volt should work.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo you're walking into town?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou don't have a car?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNo - no car.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah. Me neither - well I share one with my sister, she's borrowing mine. I was about to go get it in town - there's a hardware store in Branford that could have those batteries. Want to walk together?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nEXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal scenes, and neighborhoods, and sidewalks. As they approach one in particular - a patch of tall marsh grass - Dallas stops.\r\n\r\nDallas, sheepishly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he pulls out a pocket recorder - and points it at the marsh.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat's with the toy.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nOh, it's an audio recorder.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nBe careful - there are coyotes up in that.\r\n\r\nDallas continues to record.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nCome on champ. Hey - there's a fellowship lunch at my church today, CPC. You should come. Free food. We're going to be late though.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nEXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. The building looks closed. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou have got to be kidding me!\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nHe rips the ticket off, waving it at the empty street.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC (CONT'D)\r\nTwelve minutes! I was over twelve minutes. You see this, Dallas? This is where the taxes go. Not to fixing the potholes or the raccoon problem—oh no—it goes to the guy with the ticket book.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic walks around and wiggles his hand above the car tire - finding a secret key here.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThis is not where it is supposed to go.\r\n\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAs Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nHey you hungry?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nGood - my church is doing a fellowship lunch - little picnic - we'll go first and fuel up before getting the car. Don't worry Pal - we'll get your batteries together. \r\n\r\nINT. CAR - DRIVING TO CPC\r\n\r\nDominic drives from Branford Town Center toward the church. Dallas in the passenger seat.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo where you from?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIndiana\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nIndiana - how'd you land up here in Branford? \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWork\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah? Where abouts\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYale?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNo - maybe - but for now Quinnipiac.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThat's refreshing.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nThey pull into the church lot. The fellowship lawn is ahead—picnic in full swing.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 3: Marsh Walk\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk | File: 03_marsh_walk.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER\r\n\r\nThe sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.\r\n\r\nDominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nSee this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYour little toy showing you good results?\r\nI prefer the raw feed.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nSuit yourself. But there’s a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.\r\n\r\nDallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 4: The Fellowship\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: fellowship | File: 04_fellowship.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in heat of a picnic. Children are running, friends in light summerwear play spike ball, and people are on line getting food. Dallas looks around at all of the new faces but does not make eye contact. Dominic takes a deep breath, also appearing a little nervous. \r\n\r\nDominic carries a package of water and puts it under one of the fold up tables. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nAlright buddy - let's wait on line I guess. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic and Dallas wait on line to be served at fellowship lunch. \r\n\r\nJanice, Mid 50s, puts her hand on Dominic's shoulder.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSister.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nBrother.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThis is Dallas.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nHello.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nHey Dallas. Dominic did you get the car?\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nMAKAYLA, 22, and ASHER, 15 - emerge behind Janice. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n(ignoring Janice)\r\nDallas, these are my niece and nephew - Makayla and Asher.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nMakayla and Asher don't say much but wait online. Makayla taps Asher on the shoulder and nods towards a far end of the church lawn. Between the bushes and garden. \r\n\r\nThe two leave the line for food and walk over to it. Dallas watches.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nSo what happened Dominic. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah - and it had a ticket.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nHow much. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nA good amount. \r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nThat's great. \r\n\r\nJanice leaves the line of food.\r\n\r\nDallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted, listening.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo, what are you here for?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWork.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nAt Yale?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nQuinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat kind of work?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nBioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh—birds, insects, coyotes. I start next semester.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNice. So are you here alone?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nOkay cool. That's cool.\r\n\r\nThey finish eating. The group begins to disperse.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nWant to walk back together? I'll show you around.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n\r\nSure.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\n\r\nThey start walking towards the marsh, towards the New England coast.\r\n\r\nIn the far distance, COYOTES HOWL.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 5: Marsh Trail\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk-later | File: 05_marsh_walk.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER\r\n\r\nThe sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.\r\n\r\nDominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nSee this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\n\r\nDallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.\r\n\r\nDominc\r\nWhat the heck is that?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIt's a portable Oscillator. It tells me what kind of low frequencies are in the air - to see if it is worth recording. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nSuit yourself. But lately - i've heard rumors that there's a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 6: News Vans & Trash Cans\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: 06_news_vans.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. BRANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic reach back to their neighborhood. Outside, nestled between their house, three news vans are parked haphazardly. \r\n\r\nPAT CLENDENEN\r\n(to camera)\r\nThis afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. \r\n...and while we're all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday's festival, but folks, get those generators ready!\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic scoffs as they walk past.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nPat's been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas notices that there is some red eyes lurking in the windsill reflections. \r\n\r\nThe wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.\r\n\r\nEXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - LATER\r\n\r\nThey arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThose damn raccoons! I just put these out!\r\n\r\nDominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at his front door, then at Dallas.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC (CONT'D)\r\nLook, I gotta clean this up and get the furniture moved before the men's group tonight. I got to go check on Mike and bring in another AC unit from the basement. You busy? \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(hesitates)\r\nSure. \r\n\r\nINT. DOMINIC'S BASEMENT \r\nDallas and Dominic move an AC unit - as they go to install it - Dallas notices a strange burn mark on the ground near the tall grass. \r\n\r\nHe walks over to it and examines it - he brings out his oscillator and then begins to record it a bit. The readings are off.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 7: The Coordinates\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-coordinates | File: 07_the_coordinates.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe house smells like old wood and floor wax. Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall.\r\n\r\nAs they move - Dominic knocks over a photo frame - and Dallas grabs it. On the ground is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nMy wife and kid. They're... gone now.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas sheepisly looks at Dominic.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat about you?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nHave you have someone that you've lost?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNo, I've never really had anyone. \r\n\r\nDominic looks toward the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged fingernail.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC \r\nMr. Mike. I take care of him now. He's had a rough go since the weather changed... He doesn't like it at all. \r\n\r\nDominic moves to the window and shuts the blinds halfway, like he's done it a thousand times.\r\n\r\nMr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a gnarled finger at the window.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nShe's here.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic is already moving—trying to calm him, trying to stop him.\r\n\r\nMr. Mike scratches faster. Dallas leans in and catches the numbers before Dominic blocks his view.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE \r\n\r\nForty-five left. Fifteen right.\r\n\r\nDallas freezes. Dominic flips the end table over—the scratchpad numbers disappear against the floorboards.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\n\r\nDominic. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nYes Mr. Mike\r\n\r\nMR.MIKE\r\nYour sister is here!\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 8: Dallas Home Night\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-home-night | File: 08_dallas_home_night.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS' HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas is home. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.\r\n\r\nHe listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(to himself)\r\nThere.\r\n\r\nHe replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. He's not just listening anymore—he's fitting pieces together.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(whispering)\r\nForty-five left. Fifteen right.\r\n\r\nHe stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.\r\n\r\nAnother burst hits the receiver—deeper, longer. The windows don't rattle yet, but Dallas feels it in his chest. He doesn't look up. He keeps writing. Equations. Approximations. The beginning of a map only he can hear.\r\n\r\nOutside, the marsh is dark. Inside, Dallas is wide awake, chasing a signal into the margins.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 9: Janice Arrival\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: janice-arrival | File: 09_janice_arrival.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nThe front door slams open. JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. Behind her, ASHER (15) and MAKAYLA (22) trudge in, staring at their phones.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\n(spitting out keys)\r\nThe traffic on I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why are you cooking the sprouts already? They'll be mush by the time the group gets here.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nI'm following the recipe, Janice.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\n(inspecting the pot)\r\nYou're boiling them? You're supposed to roast them! And the gravy—is that a lump?\r\n\r\nJanice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas's heavy receiver on the floor.\r\n\r\nJANICE \r\nWhat is this? A boat anchor?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIt's a receiver. For work.\r\n\r\nINT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nMakayla stops by Dallas's equipment. She doesn't look at it with Janice's annoyance; she looks with genuine curiosity.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nThis is military grade. What are you tracking?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nBioacoustics. Sounds in the marsh.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nDoes it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung.\r\n\r\nAsher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n(yelling from the door)\r\nEveryone in the car! We're going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!\r\n\r\nThe family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 10: Howie Walk & The First Hum\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: howie-walk | File: 10_howie_walk.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING\r\n\r\nThe Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the perimeter of his new property.\r\n\r\nDallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(to himself)\r\nWhat are you?\r\n\r\nHowie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.\r\n\r\nIn the far distance, a single dog barks. Then another.

The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.\r\n\r\nShadows—tall, spindly, and darker than the night—grow in the distance. They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships.\r\n\r\nHe touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long, desperate.\r\n\r\nThe hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames.\r\n\r\nA doorbell is heard off screen breaking Dallas out of his trance. \r\n\r\nINT.

Dallas walks Howie along the perimeter of his new property.\r\n\r\nDallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(to himself)\r\nWhat are you?\r\n\r\nHowie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.\r\n\r\nIn the far distance, a single dog barks. Then another.

They wander toward the edge of Dallas's property.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nAsher, look.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.\r\n\r\nMakayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried.

A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds.\r\n\r\nDallas and Howie step onto the narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh. \r\n\r\nAs they walk - the air changes into damp, metallic, stillness.\r\n\r\nEXT. MARSH ENTRANCE\r\n\r\nDallas and Howie stop at the creek's edge and pan glances towards the outer marsh.\r\n\r\nHowie's ears perk and he begins to gently whine, pressing against Dallas's leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. \r\n\r\nDallas crouches and lifts him, holding Howie a moment longer than necessary as he catches his breath. Howie's breathing begins to quicken. Dallas steadies him, resting his forehead briefly against Howie as he steadies him. \r\n\r\nFrom the distance a light flickers deep in the marsh. Dallas notices it - but it is gone. \r\n\r\nDallas lowers Howie to the ground and his equipment begins to beep. \r\n\r\nDallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern. \r\n\r\nDallas clicks \"Record,\" then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy. He is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.\r\n\r\nHis handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it's a repeating, melodic pattern.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(to Howie)\r\nStay here.\r\n\r\nHe ties Howie's leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.\r\n\r\nEXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves. \r\n\r\nA cry rings out. It's not a throat-sound; it's air being forced through something hollow.\r\n\r\nDallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.\r\n\r\nA flickering glow emanates from its neck. Its \"back-holes\"—delicate vents along its spine—vibrate as it breathes, creating the sound that syncs perfectly with Dallas's receiver.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 15: Creature Rescue\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-rescue | File: 15_creature_rescue.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT.

As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.\r\n\r\nHe notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.\r\n\r\nAs Dallas lifts the fragile thing toward his chest, it lets out a faint, melodic whimper before fainting.

TALL GRASS - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas clutches the creature to his chest, its downy fur damp against his coat. The sound in the grass isn't just wind—it’s a wake. Something heavy is slicing through the reeds, rocketing toward him like an arrow.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n\r\n(to himself)\r\n\r\nGo, go, go.\r\n\r\nHe breaks into a sprint, stumbling over hidden roots. He reaches the cedar tree. Howie is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass. Dallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is a hundred yards behind them.\r\n\r\nHe stops at the edge of his driveway, gasping for air. He looks down at his coat. The creature is motionless, but its neck glow pulses a weak, fading amber.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 18: Makeshift Hospital\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: makeshift-hospital | File: 18_makeshift_hospital.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - LATER\r\n\r\nDallas has turned his kitchen island into a triage station. He’s wired a portable oscilloscope to the creature’s head using tiny alligator clips.\r\n\r\nThe device pulses in a rhythmic, green jagged line—perfectly in sync with the creature's heartbeat.\r\n\r\nThe creature begins to fade - Dallas turns the dial into another frequency range and waits until it is asleep. \r\n\r\nMakayla \r\n(to Dallas)\r\nWhat does that do?\r\n\r\nDallas\r\n(whispering)\r\nIt changes the frequency I am transmitting.\r\n\r\nMakayla\r\nAnd you think that it somehow is like talking to the creature?\r\n\r\nDallas\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nAsher comes in the room and gathers around the creature as well. \r\n\r\nDallas adjusts the dial on his military receiver to a 115.3 MHz frequency. The creature’s breathing stabilizes. It lets out a low, melodic tone through its back-holes.\r\n\r\nHowie sits in the corner, head cocked, shivering. Outside, the world responds: the windows rattle, and a deep, distant hum echoes from the town center.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 19: Entering Grass\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: entering-grass-2 | File: 19_entering_grass.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT.
