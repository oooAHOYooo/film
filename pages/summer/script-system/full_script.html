DALLAS NEW HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas stares at the Tall Grass outside his house as he unloads boxes from a big pile. \r\n\r\nDallas goes into the grass a little bit and as he does he notices that there is a makeshift trap - a small rig of a stick. Upon further examination he notices that it is not a trap but a recording device of sorts. \r\n\r\nAs Dallas examines he hears a distinct bicycle ring.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA, 22 and ASHER, 14 - approach on bikes. They watch him for a while.\r\n\r\nThey approach Dallas slowly as one of the boxes draws their curiousity. Makayla watches Dallas pull out a military grade Oscillator.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\n(to Asher but loud enough for Dallas to hear)\r\nYou know that could be used to track the baseline difference between the cry of the BinzoBee and the howl of the Ophragah.\r\n\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAsher nods. Makayla approaches Dallas. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nHey mister. \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYes?\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nIs that an Oscillator?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nMakayla looks at Asher and whispers something in his ear. He nods. She returns glances to Dallas and inches her bike closer. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nDo you think my brother Asher could borrow it some time? \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas looks at the Oscillator and then at Makayla and Asher\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nHe needs it to gather evidence.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat kind of evidence? \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nTell him Asher. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAsher stands silent in a sheepish shyness.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nDoes it work?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIt does - but you need a power source. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWhat if we connect audio cables to it - could we put some microphones in the tall grass and it'll reach it.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nI suppose. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWhat if I found a weird stone that pulses when storms approach - would it pick that up?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nI'm not sure.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWell okay. Asher do you have any questions. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nMakayla turns to Asher. He shakes his head no. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nOkay then. Byeeeeeee.\r\n\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nMakayla and Asher peddle their bikes away. Dallas watches curiously and then peers at the swinging breeze of the tall grass. \r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 2: Dallas Night\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-night | File: 02_dallas-night.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas struggles to fall asleep in his new home. He hears strange noises from outside. As he looks out the window he sees a flicker of a faint gold light. \r\n\r\nCurious and wide awake - Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving supplies and a few pieces of furniture.\r\n\r\nHe hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers through his living room window. \r\n\r\nDallas looks back at a pile of unopened boxes in the middle of his living room. He hestitates but makes his way towards a box marked \"Sierra\".\r\n\r\nDallas pulls out a heavy, a bunch of old vanilla folders, another military-grade desktop Oscillator, a portable audio recorder, an a portable Oscillator. <!-- [ADDITION] Sierra folder seed — plants the discovery Makayla makes in Scene 22 -->\r\nOne of the folders slips open as he lifts it—inside, a glimpse of hand-drawn sketches and a tab labeled \"FIELD NOTES — BRANFORD 1978.\" Dallas closes it without looking and sets the stack aside.\r\n<!-- [/ADDITION] -->\r\nIn the bottom of the box, covered in dust, sumberged by cables,  Dallas finds and old pair of retro red headphones.\r\n\r\nOn one of the headphones, Dallas peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.\r\n\r\nThe photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.\r\n\r\nDallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.\r\n\r\nDallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.\r\n\r\nAs he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside.\r\n\r\nDallas walks to the window and attempts to record the readings, and just as it capturing something, the battery dies.  \r\n\r\nHe sets the receiver down and heads for the door.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS HOUSE\r\n\r\nDallas stands alone watching the tall grass sway agaisnt the salt breeze. \r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 3: The Hum\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: 03_the-hum.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NEXT DAY MORNING\r\nDallas walks outside and watches the tall grass sway in the wind. As he walks he notices a man approaching him from the sidewalk near his house. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC, early 40s, wearing a bright salmon covered short sleeve button up approaches Dallas with great vigor. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNeighbor!\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat's that?\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou are my neighbor - we saw you the other day driving by - did you just move here?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nOh - yeah.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNice. Names Dominic.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nDallas, what a cool name - - What you up to?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nI'm just walking into town - got to get some batteries.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat kind of batteries?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n9 Volt should work.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo you're walking into town?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou don't have a car?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNo - no car.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah. Me neither - well I share one with my sister, she's borrowing mine. I was about to go get it in town - there's a hardware store in Branford that could have those batteries. Want to walk together?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nEXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal scenes, and neighborhoods, and sidewalks. As they approach one in particular - a patch of tall marsh grass - Dallas stops.\r\n\r\nDallas, sheepishly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he pulls out a pocket recorder - and points it at the marsh.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat's with the gadget?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nOh, it's an audio recorder.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nBe careful - there are coyotes up in that.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas continues to record.\r\n\r\nEXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. The building looks closed. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou have got to be kidding me!\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nHe rips the ticket off and walks around to see if anyone is looking - and finds a secret key. \r\n\r\nAs Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.\r\n\r\n<!-- [ADDITION] First grid instability hint -->\r\nThe streetlight above them flickers. Once. Twice. Then steadies. Dallas watches it for a beat, then looks back at the birds.\r\n<!-- [/ADDITION] -->\r\n\r\nDominic opens the car and gestures Dallas to get in - non-chantanly the parking ticket in the glove box. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nHey you hungry?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(still in a daze)\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nGood - tomorrow my church is doing a fellowship lunch - little picnic - I am bringing in a tray.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo where you from?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIndiana\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nIndiana - how'd you land up here in Branford? \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWork\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah? Where abouts\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYale?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNo - maybe - but for now Quinnipiac.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThat's refreshing.\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 4: Marsh Trail\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk-later | File: 04_marsh_walk.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- [DELETION] STRUCTURAL — Merge Merlin app + \"movement underneath\" into Scene 03; cut the rest -->\r\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER\r\n\r\nThe sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.\r\n\r\nDominic and Dallas walk quietly for a while. Dominic looks out to the tall grass.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThe kids are always out here with their cameras.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\n\r\nDominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nSee this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\n\r\nDallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.\r\n\r\nDominc\r\nWhat the heck is that?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIt's a portable Oscillator. It tells me what kind of low frequencies are in the air - to see if it is worth recording. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nSuit yourself. But lately - i've heard rumors that there's a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.\r\n<!-- [/DELETION] -->\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 5: News Vans & Trash Cans\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: 05_news_vans.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. BRANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic reach back to their neighborhood. Outside, nestled between their house, three news vans are parked haphazardly. \r\n\r\nDominic parks the car and the two get out to see. \r\n\r\nPAT CLENDENEN, MID 50s, is outside their house in front of news cameras. \r\n\r\nPAT CLENDENEN\r\n(to camera)\r\nThis afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. \r\n...and while we're all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. <!-- [ADDITION] Pat names brownouts — sets up Makayla's substation line in Scene 18 -->\r\nWe're also getting reports of rolling brownouts along the Route 146 corridor—UI says it's weather-related surges, but they're sending a crew to check the Branford substation.\r\n<!-- [/ADDITION] -->\r\nHopefully, it holds off until after Sunday's festival, but folks, get those generators ready!\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic scoffs as they walk past.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nPat's been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nThe wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.\r\n\r\nEXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE \r\n\r\nThey arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThose raccoons! \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at the garbage cans around his house, then at Dallas.\r\n\r\nDallas notices that there are some weird burn marks on the ground. He gazes at them for a bit of time. <!-- [DELETION] Grid flicker — redundant with Pat's brownout report above; save visual proof for Scenes 10/11 -->\r\nAbove him, the streetlight at the end of the driveway cycles—on, off, on—in a slow, deliberate rhythm that doesn't match the others on the block.\r\n<!-- [/DELETION] -->\r\nDominic continues to clean the mess from the garbage and Dallas continues to help not  paying attention to what Dominic is handing him, first a garbage bag, then a leaf bag, then up to - but helping none the less. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nListen, I got to get the furniture moved before the men's group tonight. I got to go check on Mike and bring in another AC from the basement. You good? \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(hesitates)\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nDo you want to stay for a bit?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nSure. \r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 6: The Coordinates\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-coordinates | File: 06_the_coordinates.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DOMINIC'S BASEMENT \r\nDallas and Dominic move an AC unit - as they go to install it. \r\n\r\nHe walks over to it and examines it - he brings out his oscillator and then begins to record it a bit. The readings are off.\r\n\r\nINT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM \r\n\r\nDallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall. As they move - Dominic knocks over a photo frame - and Dallas grabs it. On the ground is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nMy wife and kid... Gone now. Dallas grab the leg\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas grabs the leg of the table and pushes. The two look at the table for a while. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat about you?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nHave you have someone that you've lost?\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas falls mute. Dominic scans the room and finds his gaze upon the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged nail.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC \r\nMr. Mike! Hey - what are you doing? \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nMr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a finger at the window.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nShe's here! Hey Dominic! Look - she's here.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhose hear? Why are you scratching the table?\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nYour sister.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic dashes for the door and opens it. In pops Janice with Makayla and Asher. \r\n\r\nDallas meanwhile walks towards Mr. Mike before Dominic blocks his view.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE \r\nForty-five left. Fifteen right. She's here - Dominic - Janice is here - ASHER! - it is playing the same one Elena chased. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAsher rushes over to Mr. Mike and eye's widen when he see's what he has been writing. Asher runs to Makayla - who starts to jot the numbers on the table on her palm. \r\n\r\n\r\nINT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nJANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. \r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nTraffic the I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why aren't you cooking the sprouts already? We need to boil them first and then sear them. Last time you just boiled them and it was a disgusting mush... Hi Dallas. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou got it Janice. Anything for the brussels.  \r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\n\r\nJanice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas's heavy receiver on the floor.\r\n\r\nJANICE \r\nWhat is this? A boat anchor?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIt's a receiver. For work.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nMr. Mike in the distance begins to get agitated\r\n\r\nMR. Mike\r\nAnd when you hurt one - eventually they will transform into the other one - they wont stay kind forever. If the winds get them - they will take charge.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nJanice walks over and grabs Howie from the car and hands them to Dallas.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nDo you mind watching Howie for a bit this afternoon - I have to take everyone to costco\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas looks at the dog - the dog Howie looks back at the man Dallas. Makayla walks over and grabs the portable Oscillator holding in Dallas' hand. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nHave you given any thought to what I asked you the other day?\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas looks at Makayla and back at Asher\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nLet my brother borrow it. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAsher walks over to Mr. Mike to see how he is doing. Makayla approaches Dallas even further. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nDoes it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung. <!-- [DELETION] Makayla grid line — too early for her arc; save expertise for Scene 18 oscilloscope -->And the streetlights on our block were doing that thing again—cycling on and off. Every time I hear the sound, the lights go weird.<!-- [/DELETION] -->\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAsher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n(yelling from the door)\r\nEveryone in the car! We're going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!\r\n\r\nThe family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 7: Dallas Marsh Walk\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-marsh-walk | File: 07_dallas_marsh_walk.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - EVENING\r\n\r\nDallas walks home with Howie. \r\n\r\nDallas walks with Howie along the coastal trail. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the tall grass. He carries his portable receiver, the dials clicking softly as he adjusts the frequency.\r\n\r\nDallas stops at the creek's edge and pans his gaze towards the outer marsh. The tall grass stretches endlessly before him, golden-yellow reeds swaying gently despite the lack of wind.\r\n\r\nThe air is still, too still. No birds. No wind. Just the distant sound of unseen water lapping against the shore.\r\n\r\nDallas steps off the boardwalk onto a narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh.\r\n\r\nThere in the distance he sees a distubrance. He walks over to a makeshift trap with a trailcam over it. He notices that it is wired to a solar pack and away from itself. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHis equipment begins to beep. Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern.\r\n\r\nHowie begins to bark a little - and Dallas stops him \r\nHe clicks \"Record,\" then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy.\r\n\r\nFrom the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh.

MARSH TRAIL - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas walks the coastal trail with Howie. Suddenly, the air vibrates. A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds.\r\n\r\nDallas and Howie step onto the narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh. \r\n\r\nAs they walk - the air changes into damp, metallic, stillness.\r\n\r\nEXT. MARSH ENTRANCE\r\n\r\nDallas and Howie stop at the creek's edge and pan glances towards the outer marsh.\r\n\r\nHowie's ears perk and he begins to gently whine, pressing against Dallas's leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. \r\n\r\nDallas crouches and lifts him, holding Howie a moment longer than necessary as he catches his breath. Howie's breathing begins to quicken. Dallas steadies him, resting his forehead briefly against Howie as he steadies him. \r\n\r\nFrom the distance a light flickers deep in the marsh. Dallas notices it - but it is gone. \r\n\r\nDallas lowers Howie to the ground and his equipment begins to beep. \r\n\r\nDallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern. \r\n\r\nDallas clicks \"Record,\" then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy. He is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.\r\n\r\nHis handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it's a repeating, melodic pattern.\r\n\r\nHe ties Howie's leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.\r\n\r\nEXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves. \r\n\r\nA cry rings out. It's not a throat-sound; it's air being forced through something hollow.\r\n\r\nDallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.\r\n\r\nA flickering glow emanates from its neck.

The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.\r\n\r\nHe notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.\r\n\r\nAs Dallas lifts the fragile thing toward his chest, it looks out and cries for the crystal—in vain. It faints. The scope in his pocket goes silent.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the reeds—something massive, rocketing through the blades like an arrow.

She opens drawers quietly. Finds sugar cubes meant for coffee. Pockets one without a word.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - SAME TIME\r\n\r\nDallas shuffles through a pile of old equipment—mono cables, spare parts. The creature doesn't look like it's doing much. It's breathing, slightly. Dallas struggles to find a bed for it. He settles on an old shoebox—pauses when he sees his wife's handwriting on one, sets that aside—and gently nestles the creature inside. Its little feet curl tightly. It breathes slowly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe finds a way to poke a hole in something so it can drink. MAKAYLA and ASHER watch from the staircase. Makayla comes down. She takes out the crystal. It begins to glow. Her hair lifts. She and the creature seem to communicate—a beat of shared attention. The creature's glow dims as she pulls her hand away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - LATER\r\n\r\nPeople mill and talk. Someone asks where Dallas is.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWe found a little cat. Dallas is downstairs nursing it.\r\n\r\nA woman stands—early fifties, warm.\r\n\r\nWOMAN\r\nI'm a vet. I could take a look.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nI mean— no, that's okay. I think that cat's just sleeping. We could check after?\r\n\r\nAn elderly woman nods. Everyone agrees. Someone asks how Howie is doing—where is Howie. JOSH, one of the young couples, leads the group. \r\n\r\nHe starts an opening ice breaker. Dallas, Dominic, Makayla, and Asher sit silent. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nSARAH, the vet, notices a physical reaction to her cup of tea - and watches it ripple in a strange way. \r\n\r\nTYLER, a young man with a guitar, hands out music sheets.\r\n\r\nTYLER\r\nSomething to settle the nerves.

Pressure's dropping fast.\r\n\r\nDallas stares at the basement door. The sound isn't the wind. It's an answer.\r\n\r\nDuring a silent moment of reflection, the hum starts again. Everyone is unsettled. What was that noise? The group settles on the weird weather—the storm, the patterns plaguing Branford. \r\n\r\nIn time, people leave. Hugs. Goodbyes. Dominic waves them out. He waits for the last person to leave. Then he rushes downstairs with the kids.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 22: Red Eyes\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: red-eyes | File: 22_red_eyes.md*\n\n---\n\nINT.

The crowd—Dominic, Makayla, Asher—gather around. The creature, like a little bird, responds to the equipment. Curious. Fragile.\r\n\r\nAsher enters the room. Makayla follows. Dallas ignores their presence, focused on the creature. Everyone's eyes widen. The creature wakes up. It goes into an almost frozen state—as if it's operating on a different timeline.\r\n\r\nDallas excuses himself. He needs air.\r\n\r\nMakayla gently places the sugar cube near the creature. The creature leans toward it. The sound from its back-holes evens out. Makayla slides the sugar cube two inches farther away. She watches what happens.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas stands alone. In a trance. He looks out at the tall grass for a long time. He slowly turns a dial on the receiver. The hum shifts.

The trail leads toward the salt marsh. As they inch closer, they see them: a group of creatures, birdlike and small, gathered in a loose circle. They are attending to the injured one—the one from the shoebox. Gentle, urgent.\r\n\r\nDallas and Makayla slow. Howie whines. The creatures have not yet scattered. For a moment, it looks like help.

Their bodies are no longer their own. The hum rolls over them. They are walking backward, away from the circle, step by step. Howie whines, pulled with them.\r\n\r\nMore lights appear. Dozens of golden glows rise like lanterns in the mist. Then the red eyes. They multiply at the edge of the reeds, contrasting with the gold.\r\n\r\nThe red eyes begin to circle the golden ones.

The small creatures huddle in terror.\r\n\r\nDallas and Makayla move slowly at first, then break into a brisk walk back the way they came. Dallas glances back.\r\n\r\nIn the distance: the tiny creature. Its pulse blinks large once—then dims. An awful sound of gnashing. Something has it.\r\n\r\nDallas stops. He pulls out the dial. He turns it. The creature's pulse flares again. The predators retract. In that split second, Dallas runs forward, grabs the creature, and runs.\r\n\r\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas runs with the creature in his coat. He stops. Looks down. The creature has stopped pulsing. It is motionless. He sets it down. Other golden pulses gather around it. The hum drops—lower and lower on the bass scale.\r\n\r\nDallas backs away. Makayla and Howie are already at the edge of the grass. He catches up.

He positions them facing the marsh, angled toward each other, creating a narrow corridor between them. He checks the meter. Adjusts. Checks again.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA watches. She walks over. She pulls Sierra's folder from her jacket. Points to a sketch—a waveform diagram with two opposing frequencies colliding.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nPhase cancellation.

She has mastered the tool he gave her.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, dark eyes appear around them. Another creature of the same size emerges and begins to nurture the one Makayla holds.\r\n\r\nDallas kneels beside her. He makes contact with the creature through his receiver. The creature begins to sing—and Makayla's oscillator catches the song, amplifies it, pushes it outward in a wave that rolls across the marsh.\r\n\r\nThe crew are paralyzed—and so are the dark forces. The Red-Eyes don't just cower. They lock in place—stun-locked, the same phase cancellation Makayla designed at the gap. Total silence around the predators.

Behind him, a window or screen shows southern New England—fog, clearing skies.\r\n\r\nPAT CLENDENEN\r\nThe Nor'easter's last-second shift—call it an unlikely miracle. Either way, a good safety warning. This town's prepared now.\r\n\r\nBehind him, in the background fog, a faint red-pulsing eye appears. One moment. Then it's gone.\r\n\r\nEXT. CHURCH GROUNDS - DAY\r\n\r\nA church event. Picnic tables. Nica's catered lunch. DOMINIC and DALLAS greet each other. They don't talk much. They sit next to each other. Eat. Still don't talk much.\r\n\r\nIn the distance: ASHER and MAKAYLA. They're crouched near the playground, watching something small. Makayla pulls a jar from her bag. A tiny caterpillar. She eases it inside. They're building little devices of their own—wires, batteries, scraps. <!-- [ADDITION] Sierra's folder on the bench — legacy continues as science -->\r\nOn the bench next to them: Sierra's folder, open. They're cross-referencing her sketches with their own observations.\r\n<!-- [/ADDITION] -->\r\nThis is just the start of the creature adventure. They don't say it. It's in the way they move. <!-- [ADDITION] -->The legacy continues—not as ghost stories, but as science.<!-- [/ADDITION] -->\r\n\r\nDallas watches them. He doesn't say anything.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S WORKSHOP / HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas at his desk. The tape recorder plays his late wife's voice. He fiddles with a recording mechanism. Wires. A modified receiver. He finally gets it working. He hits record. From outside, the hum from the tall grass bleeds into the room. He listens. He begins to sketch—notations, marks. An alphabet. Something to capture it.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas goes to bed. The device sits on the nightstand. He hears echoes. Something beyond the shadows he saw before. He lies there. Listening.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - MORNING\r\n\r\nJANICE pulls up. She gets out. She and Dallas hug. She hands him HOWIE's leash. Dallas greets the little dog with real affection. They stare at each other for a while. Howie's ears twitch. He's disturbed by something out in the tall grass. Dallas looks at his watch. Then toward the creek.\r\n\r\nEXT. CREEK BEND - DAY\r\n\r\nThe place where the lawn becomes reed. The same bend from before. Dallas stops. He lifts the receiver. He tunes the dial. The hum rises, falls. He adjusts again. The dial clicks into place. He stands there. Recording. The tall grass moves. He doesn't move. He listens.\r\n\n\n---\n\n";
