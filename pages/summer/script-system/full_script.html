DALLAS NEW HOUSE - DAY\n\nDallas stares at the Tall Grass outside his house as he unloads boxes from a big pile. Dallas scans the new backyard, there are some old rusty lawn furtniture and a picnic table that seems to be adjacent to a fence of grass \n\nDallas goes into the grass a little bit and as he does he notices that there is a makeshift trap - a small rig of a stick. Upon further examination he notices that it is not a trap but a recording device of sorts. \n\nAs Dallas examines he hears a distinct bicycle ring.\n\nMAKAYLA, 22 and ASHER, 14 - approach on bikes. They watch him for a while.\n\nThey approach Dallas slowly as one of the boxes draws their curiousity. Makayla watches Dallas pull out a military grade Oscillator.\n\nMAKAYLA\n(to Asher but loud enough for Dallas to hear)\nYou know that could be used to track the baseline difference between the cry of the BinzoBee and the howl of the Ophragah.\n\n\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nAsher nods. Makayla approaches Dallas. \n\nMAKAYLA\nHey mister. \n\nDALLAS\nYes?\n\nMAKAYLA\nIs that an Oscillator?\n\nDALLAS\nYes. \n\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nMakayla looks at Asher and whispers something in his ear. He nods. She returns glances to Dallas and inches her bike closer. \n\nMAKAYLA\nDo you think my brother Asher could borrow it some time? \n\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nDallas looks at the Oscillator and then at Makayla and Asher\n\nMAKAYLA\nHe needs it to gather evidence.\n\nDALLAS\nWhat kind of evidence? \n\nMAKAYLA\nTell him Asher. \n\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nAsher stands silent in a sheepish shyness.\n\nMAKAYLA\nDoes it work?\n\nDALLAS\nIt does - but you need a power source. \n\nMAKAYLA\nWhat if we connect audio cables to it - could we put some microphones in the tall grass and it'll reach it.\n\nDALLAS\nI suppose. \n\nMAKAYLA\nWhat if I found a weird stone that pulses when storms approach - would it pick that up?\n\nDALLAS\nI'm not sure.\n\nMAKAYLA\nWell okay. Asher do you have any questions. \n\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nMakayla turns to Asher. He shakes his head no. \n\nMAKAYLA\nOkay then. Byeeeeeee.\n\n\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nMakayla and Asher peddle their bikes away. Dallas watches curiously and then peers at the swinging breeze of the tall grass. \n\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 2: Dallas Night\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-night | File: s02.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 02 file: s02.md nickname: dallas-night -->\n\n<!-- nickname: dallas-night -->\n\nINT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nDallas struggles to fall asleep in his new home. He hears strange noises from outside. As he looks out the window he sees a flicker of a faint gold light. \n\nCurious and wide awake - Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving supplies and a few pieces of furniture.\n\nHe hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers through his living room window. \n\nDallas looks back at a pile of unopened boxes in the middle of his living room. He hestitates but makes his way towards a box marked \"Sierra\".\n\nDallas pulls out a heavy, a bunch of old vanilla folders, another military-grade desktop Oscillator, a portable audio recorder, an a portable Oscillator. \n\nOne of the folders slips open as he lifts it—inside, a glimpse of hand-drawn sketches and a tab labeled \"FIELD NOTES — BRANFORD 2004.\" Dallas closes it without looking and sets the stack aside.\n\nIn the bottom of the box, covered in dust, sumberged by cables,  Dallas finds and old pair of retro red headphones.\n\nOn one of the headphones, Dallas peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.\n\nThe photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.\n\nDallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.\n\nDallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.\n\nAs he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside. The sound is faint and he listens\n\nDallas walks to the window and attempts to record the readings, and just as it capturing something, the battery dies. \n\n\nScrambling, Dallas looks through his box of equipment for other devices but they all take C batteries. \n\nDallas, fustrated, throws down the equipment and heads for the door. \n\nEXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NIGHT\n\nDallas stands alone watching the tall grass sway agaisnt the salt breeze. The hum seems to be decreasing in scale and size as the night disappears into the distance of the tall marsh grass.\n\nINT. DALLAS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nDallas struggles to go to sleep. As he hears more faint cries he looks out the window and sees a faint golden glow again. \n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 3: The Hum\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: s03.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->\n\n<!-- nickname: the-hum -->\n\nEXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NEXT DAY MORNING\nDallas walks outside his house, towards the edge of the property. As he approaches the edge of his yard he watches the tall grass sway in the wind. He looks at the grass for a beat too long, as he nurses the C battery in his hand. As he does so, he becomes dazed.\n\nA faint hum is heard off in the distance of the tall grass - low from the earth. Dallas looks at his watch and begins clicking with his hand. And then he writes down some numbers on a sticky note. \"3, 5, 1\" \n\nAs Dallas focuses, he notices a man approaching him from the sidewalk near his house. \n\nDOMINIC AMARANTO, early 40s, wearing a bright salmon covered short sleeve button up approaches Dallas with great vigor. \n\nDOMINIC\nNeighbor!\n\nDALLAS\nWhat's that?\n\nDOMINIC\nYou are my neighbor - we saw you the other day driving by - did you just move here?\n\nDALLAS\nOh - yeah.\n\nDOMINIC\nNice. Names Dominic.\n\nDALLAS\nDallas.\n\nDOMINIC\nDallas, what a cool name - - What you up to?\n\nDALLAS\nI'm just walking into town - got to get some batteries.\n\nDOMINIC\nOh yeah? Where abouts?\n\nDALLAS\nNot sure, I was just going to go to the hardware store. \n\nDOMINIC\nSo you're walking into town?\n\nDALLAS\nYeah.\n\nDOMINIC\nYou don't have a car?\n\nDALLAS\nNo - no car.\n\nDOMINIC\nYeah. Me neither - well I share one with my sister, she's borrowing mine. I was about to go  - there's a hardware store in Branford that could have those batteries. Would you like to tag along?\n\nDALLAS\nSure.\n\nEXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE\n\nDallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal sidewalks, neighborhoods, and natural marsh fences. As they approach one patch of tall marsh grass in particular, Dallas stops.\n\nDallas, sheepishly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he mumbles to himself. \n\nDOMINIC\nBe careful - there are coyotes up in that. Some people say the noises are from owls - but I know its coyotes. \n\n\n\nEXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY\n\nDallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. \n\nINT. HARDWARE STORE\n<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->\n\n(action)\nDominic waves to the unfriendly man at the counter and brings Dallas to the battery section. \n\nDOMINIC\nSo where you from?\n\nDALLAS\nIndiana.\n\nDOMINIC\nINDIANAAAA - how'd you land up here in Branford?\n\n<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->\n\n(action)\nDallas finds the correct batteries and grabs it off the shelf. \n\nDALLAS\nWork.\n\nDOMINIC\nYeah? Where abouts? Yale?\n\nDALLAS\nQuinipiac. \n\nDOMINIC\nThat's refreshing... What are you doing with Quinipiac\n\nDALLAS\nMostly field and bioacoustics. \n\n\nThe building looks closed. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.\n\nDOMINIC\nYou got to be kidding me!\n\n<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->\n\n(action)\nHe rips the ticket off and walks around to see if anyone is looking - and finds a secret key. \n\nAs Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.\n\nThe streetlight above them flickers. Once. Twice. Then steadies. Dallas watches it for a beat, then looks back at the birds.\n\nDominic opens the car and gestures Dallas to get in - non-chantanly the parking ticket in the glove box. \n\nDOMINIC\nYou hungry?\n\nDALLAS\n(still in a daze)\nYeah\n\nDOMINIC\nGood -  my church is doing a fellowship lunch - little picnic - I got to go to the bakery and bring a tray. You should come. \n\nDALLAS\nSure. \n\n<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->\n\n(action)\nDOMINIC\nNice - yeah - it's nice to be the new guy in town - good old branford. \n\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 4: The Fellowship\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: fellowship | File: s04.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n<!-- nickname: fellowship -->\n\nEXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nDallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in heat of a picnic. Children are running, friends down light summerwear as they play spike ball, and church goers find themselvees are on a long line getting food. Dallas looks around at all of the new faces but does not make great eye contact. Dominic takes a deep breath and approaches the long line. \n\nDominic carries a package of water and puts it under one of the fold up tables. As he does so, people look at Dallas and begin to greet him. \n\nDOMINIC\nAlright buddy - let's wait on line I guess. \n\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n(action)\nDominic and Dallas wait on line to be served at fellowship lunch. As they do people begin to turn around and talk to them. One lady, MARY, 55 turns around and shakes Dallas' hand enthustiaclly.\n\nMARY\nWell hey there sunshine\n\nDALLAS\nHello\n\nMARY\nDominic where did you get this Califorina boy from? My name is Mary - do you like chicken primevro?\n\nDALLAS\nNever really had it\n\nMARY\nWell you should, its great.... So you ready for some proper New England weather?\n\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n(action)\nAnother turns around and greets Dallas. An older gentleman PAUL WILDLY, 72, \n\nPAUL\nThe forecasters say that it is going to be historic one. Hasn't been this bad since 1977 - when Nixon was still in office. Paul, nice to meet you. \n\nDALLAS\nNice to meet you.\n\nPAUL\nNow, where are you from?\n\nDALLAS\nIndiana\n\nPAUL\nOo - then you must know of William Henry Harrison - our 9th president, served as Indiana's governor back when it was just a terriority. \n\nMARY\nPaul, stop that. Honey - if you need I can make you some chicken primevera\n\nDOMINIC\nHe's okay Ms Mary thank you\n\nDALLAS\nThank you. \n\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n(action)\nDallas and Dominic sit in a circle of folded pull up chairs. \n\nJANICE AMARANTO, Mid 50s, taps Dominic's shoulder.\n\nDOMINIC\nSister.\n\nJANICE\nBrother. \n\nDOMINIC\n(ignoring Janice)\nDallas, these are my niece and nephew - Makayla and Asher.\n\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n(action)\nMakayla and Asher don't say much but wait online. Makayla taps Asher on the shoulder and nods towards a far end of the church lawn. Between the bushes and garden. \n\nThe two leave the line walk over to a corner spot by the end of the church yard and huddle over a pile of brush.\n\nJANICE\nSo what happened Dominic. \n\nDOMINIC\nYeah - and it had a ticket.\n\nJANICE\nHow much. \n\nDOMINIC\nA good amount. \n\nJANICE\nThat's great. \n\nJanice leaves the line of food.\n\nDallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted by what Makayla and Asher are looking at the distance. \n\nJanice, noticing that Dallas is a little quiet - tries to spark conversation. \n\nDOMINIC\nSo, what are you here for?\n\nDALLAS\nWork.\n\nDOMINIC\nAt Yale?\n\nDALLAS\nQuinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.\n\nDOMINIC\nWhat kind of work?\n\nDALLAS\nBioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh—birds, insects, coyotes. I start next semester.\n\nDOMINIC\nNice. So are you here alone?\n\nDALLAS\nYep.\n\nDOMINIC\nOkay cool. That's cool.\n\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n(action)\nThey finish eating. The group begins to disperse. Janice walks over to Dallas and hands him Howie again. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 5: Marsh Trail\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk-later | File: s05.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 05 file: s05.md nickname: marsh-walk-later -->\n\n<!-- nickname: marsh-walk-later -->\n\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER\n\nThe sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.\n\nDominic and Dallas walk quietly for a while. Dominic looks out to the tall grass.\n\nDOMINIC\nThe kids are always out here with their cameras.\n\n<!-- scene: 05 file: s05.md nickname: marsh-walk-later -->\n\n(action)\nDominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.\n\nDOMINIC\n\nSee this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 6: News Vans & Trash Cans\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: s06.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->\n\n<!-- nickname: news-vans -->\n\nEXT. BRANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS\n\nDallas and Dominic reach back to their neighborhood. Outside, nestled between their house, three news vans are parked haphazardly. \n\nDominic parks the car and the two get out to see. \n\nPAT CLENDENEN, MID 50s, is outside their house in front of news cameras. \n\nPAT CLENDENEN\n(to camera)\nThis afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. \n...and while we're all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. \n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\nWe're also getting reports of rolling brownouts along the Route 146 corridor—UI says it's weather-related surges, but they're sending a crew to check the Branford substation.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\nHopefully, it holds off until after Sunday's festival, but folks, get those generators ready!\n\n<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->\n\n(action)\nDominic scoffs as they walk past.\n\nDOMINIC\nPat's been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.\n\n<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->\n\n(action)\nThe wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.\n\nEXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE \n\nThey arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.\n\nDOMINIC\nLook at this. Those raccoons! \n\n<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->\n\n(action)\nDominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at the garbage cans around his house, then at Dallas.\n\nDallas notices that there are some weird burn marks on the ground. He gazes at them for a bit of time. \n\nDOMINIC\nListen, I got to get the furniture before Janice has her woman's group tonight. I got to go check on Mike and bring in another fan from the basement. You good? \n\nDALLAS\n(hesitates)\nYeah\n\nDOMINIC\nDo you want to stay for a bit?\n\nDALLAS\nSure. \n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 7: The Coordinates\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-coordinates | File: s07.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->\n\n<!-- nickname: the-coordinates -->\n\nINT. JACE'S BASEMENT \n\nDallas looks around in amazement. The basement is covered with normal basement things - but then there are two beds - and around the corner there is a workstation filled with old CRT machines and what not.\n\nDOMINIC\nYeah, my niece and nephew live here. They moved in a couple of months ago. I keep trying to get them to stay in the guestroom, but they just want to be living in the basement... Here, help me grab the fan. \n\n<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->\n\n(action)\nDallas looks at all of the different equipment scattered across the room. Different audio and aoustic equipment that he seems familiar with. On the wall - there are numbers and marking similar to the three beats he wrote down. \n\nDallas and Dominic move the wall fan - as they go to install it. \n\nINT. THE JACE DINING ROOM \n\nDallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall. As they move - Dominic knocks over a photo frame - and Dallas grabs it. On the ground is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.\n\n<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->\n\n(action)\nDallas grabs the leg of the table and pushes. The two look at the table for a while. \n\nDOMINIC\nDo you have any kids?\n\nDALLAS\nNo. \n\nDOMINIC\nThis was mine. And my wife. \n\n<!-- scene: 07 file: s07.md nickname: the-coordinates -->\n\n(action)\nDallas falls mute. \n\nDOMINIC\nNow I just have my niece and nephew. \n\nDominic scans the room and finds his gaze upon the corner.

BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING\n\nThe Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the edge of his neighborhood.\n\nAs Howie, Dallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become. \n\nIt seems like the readings are pointing closer and closer to his house.\n\nHowie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.\n\nIn the far distance, a single coyote barks. Then another. A chain reaction of domestic fear starts in the neighborhood, followed by the high, thin yip of coyotes further inland.\n\nDallas pulls out his phone. A vibration and an alert for a STORM WARNING pops up.\n\nEXT. EDGE OF THE MARSH - CONTINUOUS\n\nEverything goes still. The wind stops. The waves seem to mute themselves.\n\nThen, the HUM begins.\n\nIt starts as a vibration in Dallas's teeth, then moves to his chest. It is a deep, dense, multi-layered sound—a living reed being forced through a massive throat.\n\nDallas stands in a daze, his hand tightening on Howie's leash. The tall grass pulses in time with the sound.\n\n\n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\nBehind him, the streetlights along the block go dark—all of them, at once. Three seconds of blackout. Then they snap back on, one by one, from the marsh outward, as if the power is being returned in sequence.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - EVENING\n\nDallas walks home with Howie. \n\nDallas walks with Howie along the coastal trail. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the tall grass. He carries his portable receiver, the dials clicking softly as he adjusts the frequency.\n\nDallas stops at the creek's edge and pans his gaze towards the outer marsh. The tall grass stretches endlessly before him, golden-yellow reeds swaying gently despite the lack of wind.\n\nThe air is still, too still. No birds. No wind. Just the distant sound of unseen water lapping against the shore.\n\nDallas steps off the boardwalk onto a narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh.\n\nThere in the distance he sees a distubrance. He walks over to a makeshift trap with a trailcam over it. He notices that it is wired to a solar pack and away from itself. \n\nHis equipment begins to beep. Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern.\n\nHowie begins to bark a little - and Dallas stops him. Dallas clicks \"Record,\" then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy.\n\nFrom the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas notices it—but it's gone.\n\nDallas takes a step forward, then another. The reeds part before him, closing behind him as he disappears into the tall grass.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 9: Dallas Night Work\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-night-work | File: s09.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 09 file: s09.md nickname: dallas-night-work -->\n\n<!-- nickname: the golden daze -->\n\nEXT.

Just the gentle sway of grass and the sound of his own breathing.\n\nDallas steps deeper, following the fading glow. \n\nAll around him is light reeeds blowing in an almost whirlwind of light and color. \n\nShadows—tall, spindly, and darker than the night—grow in the distance. They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships.\n\nAs Dallas' eyes adjust to this new brightness - the world around him slowly fades back to normallacly. \n\nThere in the distance Dallas sees a gnarl tree that looks a little different than the rest of the trees. \n\nDallas approaches the tree and in the bottom of it - lives a small birdlike creature - gently bioluminest - and clearly injured. \n\nDallas looks at his equipment and it seems to do funny things when he is near it. Dallas gently wraps the creature in his jacket. \n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 10: Shadows in Wind\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: shadows-in-wind | File: s10.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 10 file: s10.md nickname: shadows-in-wind -->\n\n<!-- nickname: Creature discovery -->\n\nEXT.

Smaller than the rest. Injured. It lets out a thin cry that makes the scope needle jump.\n\nDallas looks around. All at once the marsh is silent. The silence comes in waves—pressing, releasing.\n\nHe scoops the injured creature into his hands.\n\nThe air changes.\n\nA heavy, crushing sound slices through the reeds—something massive rocketing toward him like an arrow.\n\nDALLAS\n(to himself)\nGo, go, go.\n\nDallas breaks into a sprint. He reaches the stunted cedar tree—HOWIE is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass.\n\nDallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is far behind them.\n\nAt the edge of his driveway, he finally stops—gasping. The creature is motionless in his coat, but its neck glow pulses weak, fading amber.\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 11: Howie Walk (Edge of Marsh)\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: howie-walk-2 | File: s11.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 11 file: s11.md nickname: howie-walk-2 -->\n\n<!-- nickname: The Kitchen Hospital -->\nEXT.

Dallas rushes the creature over to the kitchen and upstairs to examine further. \n\nINT. DALLAS KITCHEN - DUSK\nDallas rushes to bring the creature inside. He grabs an aluminion pan and lines it with parchment paper. The creature seems to be asleep. \n\nHowie barks outside. Dallas rushes to grab him.\n\nINT. DALLAS KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\nHowie is in the living room couch very nervous and peering out the window. The camera pans and finds alone with the creature trying to understand it as he observes its features with thick macro monoculars. \n\nAs Dallas peers closer, he notices that it has marks underneath its top wing. As Dallas touches the marks the creature suddenly wakes up and lets out a cry.\n\nAs the creature cries - Dallas notices that all of the screens on his equipment turn slowly into golden static. The hue gets so vibrant and bright that permant golden marks are left scattered across all of his equipment near the creature. \n\nThe creature lets out a final whimper and slowly falls back to sleep. Dallas - looks at the mark again, as its sparkles and then fades. \n\nOutside the hum begins again, reverbating the kitchen. \n\nEXT. DALLAS BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON\n\nDallas runs outside with his audio recording equipment in his hand. The hum is growing into a faint roar from the distant marsh. \n\nAs he begins to record - the hum ceases - and he notices that the creature inside is crying loudly. \n\nINT. DALLAS KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\n\nDallas approaches it - and notices that the creature, though still seemingly asleep.\n\n\nINT. DALLAS DESK - NIGHT\n\nDallas is peered over his computer and begins to look at the recordings of the day. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.\n\nDallas as he is reading on computer - is holding a little sringe of chemicals that he hopes will replinish the creature. \n\nHe listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.\n\nDallas plays a recording of Sierra's voice to soothe the creature only to hear her voice dissolve into the creature's ongoing frequency. \n\nHe replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. \n\nHe stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.\n\nHis elbow brushes the stack of Sierra's folders. One slides open—a corner of a sketch visible. Something with wings. He pushes it closed without looking. \n\nAs he is listening another burst hits the ongoing recording. Dallas looks up from his desk and peers outside. Another faint glow. \n\nINT. DALLAS KITCHEN\nDallas makes his way to the creature. \n\nDallas looks at the creature - who is appearing to be drinking water and eating the grass - but is still sleeping inside of a gnarl of the aquarium Dallas has obviously made for it. \n\n\nINT. DALLAS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING\n\nDallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.\n\nDallas goes to look at the creature in his makeshift box. It is breathing. Dallas begins to examine all of the blood - it seems to have darkened. \n\nHe touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long.\n\nThe hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames. \n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\nThe overhead light dims—not a flicker, but a slow, steady drain, as if something is pulling the current out of the walls.

Dallas struggles to find a bed for it. He settles on an old shoebox—pauses when he sees his wife's handwriting on one, sets that aside—and gently nestles the creature inside. Its little feet curl tightly. It breathes slowly.\n\n\n\nHe finds a way to poke a hole in something so it can drink. MAKAYLA and ASHER watch from the staircase. Makayla comes down. She takes out the crystal. It begins to glow. Her hair lifts. She and the creature seem to communicate—a beat of shared attention. The creature's glow dims as she pulls her hand away.\n\n\n\nINT.

It's an answer.\n\nDuring a silent moment of reflection, the hum starts again. Everyone is unsettled. What was that noise?

TALL GRASS \n\nMakayla and Dalls find the creature in the middle of the gnarl where Dallas found it initially.\n\nThe creature’s pulse is slowing. The glow in its neck dims into a faint amber. \n\nDallas reaches out, his fingers trembling. As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.\n\nHe notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.\n\nAs Dallas lifts the fragile creature toward his chest, it looks out and cries for the crystal—in vain. It faints. The scope in his pocket goes silent.\n\nSuddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the reeds—something massive, rocketing through the blades like an arrow. Dallas gently lowers the creature to the ground.\n\nAll around him it seems like dark chaos is errupting.\n\nINT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - NIGHT\n\nThe creature sleeps in a makeshift box. Dallas has a heat lamp on it. Machines are haphazardly arranged around it—a mini-hospital. The crowd—Dominic, Makayla, Asher—gather around. The creature, like a little bird, responds to the equipment. Curious. Fragile.\n\nAsher enters the room. Makayla follows. Dallas ignores their presence, focused on the creature. Everyone's eyes widen. The creature wakes up. It goes into an almost frozen state—as if it's operating on a different timeline.\n\nDallas excuses himself. He needs air.\n\nMakayla gently places the sugar cube near the creature. The creature leans toward it. The sound from its back-holes evens out. Makayla slides the sugar cube two inches farther away. She watches what happens.\n\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\n\nDallas stands alone. In a trance. He looks out at the tall grass for a long time. He slowly turns a dial on the receiver.

The movement stops.\n\n\n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\nINT. DALLAS'S STUDY - SAME TIME\n\nMakayla sits cross-legged on the floor.

Golden creatures with back-holes and translucent ears. Dated 1978.\n\nShe flips through. More sketches. Frequency notations. A map of the marsh with circles drawn in red ink.

Drop it off where they found it.\n\nDominic, Makayla, and Asher discuss the plan. Dallas stares blankly, half listening. The hum is back. It fills the silence.\n\nThey are the last to leave. Dominic herds the kids toward the door. Dallas stays by the window a moment longer. Then he follows. The house empties.

Outside, the noise grows. Sniffs. Gnarls. The creatures. Makayla rattles in her chair, impatient.\n\nMAKAYLA\nWhat should we do?\n\nDominic looks defeated. Dallas says nothing. Mr. Mike rocks in his chair, muttering. He taps the same three beats on the armrest, over and over.\n\nMR. MIKE\nOne-one-five point three. One-one-five point three.\n\nDominic is hesitant. He asks Dallas for answers about the field. Dallas doesn't have them. Dominic argues they should focus on boarding up the house for the storm.\n\nAs he speaks—Makayla bolts. She runs out the back door, cutting across the yard toward the reeds before anyone can grab her.\n\nThe sound spikes once. Sharper. Shorter. Then it cuts.\n\nMakayla snatches the crystal from her pocket and sprints. Dominic chases her. He can't reach her in time. He hesitates at the edge of the tall grass. He cries her name. Asher and Dallas reach the grass and stare.\n\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\n\nDallas powers on the speakers and the oscillator. The trap hums to life—a low, steady broadcast aimed at the corridor between the equipment.\n\nHowie cowers next to him. Mr. Mike watches from the window. Dominic rushes past for flashlights. He tries to call Makayla on the two-way radio—Asher has the other walkie. \n\nDallas waits with Howie on the porch. He watches his equipment. The blinking orange light turns green. He hurries over to inspect. The indicator: green, then orange pulses.\n\nThe storm approaches. The two of them pace. Mr. Mike, inside, hears the thunder and yells.\n\nMR. MIKE\nThey're coming! They're coming!\n\nDallas checks the trap one last time—the speakers are holding, the sensor blinking steady between them.\n\nA distant cry. Then the low hum. Night falls. The winds pick up. Eyes circulate in the fields. Dominic grabs Dallas's sleeve. Dallas pulls free without turning around.\n\nDallas brings Howie inside. He sets the leash on the hook like he'll be back in a minute. He rubs Howie's face. Leaves the porch light on. Then he heads out to the tall grass.\n\nEXT. TALL GRASS - NIGHT\n\nA strange silence engulfs Dallas despite the wind. He sees a glimmer of fading light and moves toward it. The sensation of being watched almost overwhelms him. He keeps going.\n\nHe stops. Pulls a crumpled napkin from his pocket. Opens it: 45 L 15 R. It matches his equipment. The compass on the device.\n\nIn the distance: Makayla, holding one of the creatures. Asher and Dominic sit next to her, dazed. But Makayla isn't crying out. She isn't frozen. She is focused.\n\nIn her lap: Dallas's oscillator. She has it wired to the creature's back-holes with the alligator clips from the kitchen triage. Her fingers move across the dial with precision—adjusting, listening, adjusting again. The creature's golden pulse flickers in time with her tuning.\n\nShe is actively broadcasting—matching the creature's output frequency and amplifying it outward. The golden light around them strengthens. The dark shapes at the edge of the reeds hesitate.\n\nDallas stops. He watches her. This isn't the girl who asked \"What does that do?\" in the kitchen. She has mastered the tool he gave her.\n\nLittle by little, dark eyes appear around them. Another creature of the same size emerges and begins to nurture the one Makayla holds.\n\nDallas kneels beside her. He makes contact with the creature through his receiver. The creature begins to sing—and the oscillator catches the song, amplifies it, pushes it outward in a wave that rolls across the marsh.\n\nThe creature looks at Makayla and other creatures around it step forward. It reaches a small limb and touches the Crystal in her hand. Makayla gives it to her. The Crystal changes color - it stops glowing and settles into a rich amber solid. \n\nAnother creature chimes and the family reunites. \n\nMakayla looks down at the stone - no longer a crystal but \n\nThe crew are paralyzed—and so are the dark forces. The Red-Eyes don't just cower. They lock in place—stun-locked, the same phase cancellation Makayla designed at the gap. Total silence around the predators. Total stillness.\n\nMakayla glances down at the oscillator screen. The waveform is clean. Sharp. Unmistakable. She hits record.\n\nThe storm rages. The creatures retreat into their holes in the gnarls of the soft trees. The Red-Eyes unfreeze and scatter into the dark.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\nINT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT / DAWN\n\nDallas, Dominic, and Makayla sit by the window and watch for the night to end. It does.\n\nEXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - MORNING\n\nMorning. Dallas is still making calculations. Then he stops. \n\n<div class=\"script-deletion\">\n\n> deletion\n\nHe puts his equipment in the trash.\n\n</div>\n\n The crew leaves. Dallas is alone again.\n\nHe looks outside. The soft sound—the pulse of the creature—returns. Faint. There. He listens.\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 27: The Last Dinner\n\n*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-last-dinner | File: s27.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 27 file: s27.md nickname: the-last-dinner -->\n\n<!-- nickname: the-last-battle -->\n\nEXT. EDGE OF TALL GRASS - DAY\n\nThe crew watches from a distance. In the marsh: a battle of pulse and shadow. The red-eyed creatures surround the small ones. They devour them. A mirage of flickering yellow lights against the red. Then it all stops.\n\nThe bad creatures turn. They seek the humans.\n\nThey \n<!-- scene: 27 file: s27.md nickname: the-last-dinner -->\n\n(action)\nAsher has another panic attack on the floor - his eyes and mouth open again out in the cold marsh. \n\nASHER\nRun.\n\nDALLAS grabs ASsher \n\nThey run out of the tall grass and don't stop until they're home.\n\nEXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATER\n\nMAKAYLA AND DALLAS are out of breath. Makayla lifts up her arm and there are burn marks. She begins freaking out. \n\n\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS\n\nDallas drags his equipment to the edge of the yard—the oscillator, the military receiver, two speakers he's wired in series. He positions them facing the marsh, angled toward each other, creating a narrow corridor between them. He checks the meter. Adjusts. Checks again.\n\nMAKAYLA watches. She walks over. She pulls Sierra's folder from her jacket. Points to a sketch—a waveform diagram with two opposing frequencies colliding.\n\n\nDallas studies her face. Then he adjusts the second speaker, widening the corridor by a foot. Makayla attaches a sensor between the speakers and wires it to Dallas's receiver. The trap is acoustic—invisible. No wall. Just two frequencies waiting to collide.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\nASHER gives Dominic a tour of the equipment. Asher reaches for the dial, then pulls his hand back when it squeals.\n\n\n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\nThe storm rolls in. Makayla runs toward JANICE. Mr. Mike, Asher, and Dominic are outside. Dallas looks stunned, staring into the tall grass. Dominic, without a word, begins to help him position the equipment.\n\nDallas examines the trap. A small radio plays—PAT CLENDENEN from the news van, welcoming Branford to a beautiful southern New England morning. The contrast is cruel.\n\nThe crew stare at the tall grass. The trap is set—not a wall to hide behind, but a kill zone designed to catch a predator. Soon: the crawl of fire engines in the distance. Sea birds. And then the hum.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\nDallas walks back to the house. The crew follows. They wait on the porch. The storm is here.\n\nDOMINIC\nThis is crazy. What are we doing here.\n\nNo one answers.\n\n\n---\n\n\n## ACT IV — Aftermath\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 28: Final Echoes\n\n*ACT IV — Aftermath | ID: final-echoes | File: s28.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 28 file: s28.md nickname: final-echoes -->\n\n<!-- nickname: back to howie -->\n\nThe crew huddle around Dallas' apartment and all sleep on the floor as Mr Mike watches a movie on TV. \n\nJanice makes her way through the door.\n\nJANICE\nLook at all of these sleeping beauties. Dallas, wheres Dallas. Dallas my boy - you were spared from the storm. How are you Mike. \n\nMR. MIKE\nThings are better - things are better than what they were. Yes. \n\nJANICE\nThanks for letting everyone crash here Dallas.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 29: Aftermath\n\n*ACT IV — Aftermath | ID: aftermath | File: s29.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 29 file: s29.md nickname: aftermath -->\n\n<!-- nickname: aftermath -->\n\nEXT. BRANFORD - DAY\n\nThe town is back to normal. People move through their routines. The strange occurrences of the last few days are still on everyone's lips—muted, half-disbelieved.\n\nEXT. DALLAS HOUSE\n\n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\nDallas looks around at his property—the storm has scattered his equipment. Speakers knocked face-down in the mud. The oscillator on its side, screen cracked. But the sensor Makayla wired between them is still blinking. He picks it up. The screen shows a saved file: one clean recording.\n\nHe presses play. The sound fills the yard—alien, harmonic, unmistakable. The frequency of the golden creatures, captured clean. No noise. No interference. Just the song.\n\nDallas holds it for a long moment. He looks at the photo of Sierra on his receiver. Then he looks toward the church, where Makayla sits in the distance with the folder open.\n\nHe doesn't need to carry it alone anymore.\n\n\n</div>\n\n\n\nINT. TV STUDIO / NEWS SET - DAY\n\nPAT CLENDENEN at the anchor desk. Behind him, a window or screen shows southern New England—fog, clearing skies.\n\nPAT CLENDENEN\nThe Nor'easter's last-second shift—call it an unlikely miracle. Either way, a good safety warning. This town's prepared now.\n\nBehind him, in the background fog, a faint red-pulsing eye appears. One moment. Then it's gone.\n\nEXT. CHURCH GROUNDS - DAY\n\nA church event. Picnic tables. Nica's catered lunch. DOMINIC and DALLAS greet each other. They don't talk much. They sit next to each other. Eat. Still don't talk much.\n\nIn the distance: ASHER and MAKAYLA. They're crouched near the playground, watching something small. Makayla pulls a jar from her bag. A tiny caterpillar. She eases it inside. They're building little devices of their own—wires, batteries, scraps. \n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\nOn the bench next to them: Sierra's folder, open. They're cross-referencing her sketches with their own observations.\n\nMakayla watches how the capitillar interacts with the different patterns of her crystal.\n\nDallas watches them. from afar. \n\nINT. DALLAS'S WORKSHOP / HOUSE - DAY\n\nDallas at his desk. The tape recorder plays his late wife's voice. He fiddles with a recording mechanism. Wires. A modified receiver. He finally gets it working. He hits record. From outside, the hum from the tall grass bleeds into the room. He listens. He begins to sketch—notations, marks. An alphabet. Something to capture it.\n\nINT. DALLAS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\n\nDallas goes to bed. The device sits on the nightstand. He hears echoes. Something beyond the shadows he saw before. He lies there. Listening.\n\nEXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - MORNING\n\nJANICE pulls up. She gets out. She and Dallas hug. She hands him HOWIE's leash. Dallas greets the little dog with real affection. They stare at each other for a while. Howie's ears twitch. He's disturbed by something out in the tall grass. Dallas looks at his watch. Then toward the creek.\n\nEXT. CREEK BEND - DAY\n\nDallas walks alone with his wife's receiver in hand. The place where the lawn becomes reed. The same bend from before. Dallas stops. He lifts the receiver. He tunes the dial. The hum rises, falls. He adjusts again. The dial clicks into place. He stands there. Recording. The tall grass does not move - and neither does Dallas. \n\n\n---\n\n";
