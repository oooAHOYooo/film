DALLAS NEW HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas stares at the Tall Grass outside his house as he loads boxes. \r\n\r\nAs Dallas deals with a pile of boxes laid out by a tarp from the moving company. MAKAYLA, 22 and ASHER, 14 - approach him on bikes. They watch him for a while.\r\n\r\nThey approach Dallas slowly as one of the boxes draws their curiousity. Makayla watches Dallas pull out a military grade Oscillator.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\n(to Asher but loud enough for Dallas to hear)\r\nYou know that could be used to track the baseline difference between the cry of the BinzoBee and the howl of the Ophragah.\r\n\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAsher nods. Makayla approaches Dallas. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nIs that an Oscillator?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYes. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nDo you think my brother Asher could borrow it some time? He and his friends are hunting for evidence around the marsh.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas looks at the Oscillator and then at Makayla and Asher\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat kind of evidence? \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nTell him Asher. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAsher stands silent in a sheepish shyness.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nDoes it work?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIt does - but you need a power source. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWhat if we connect audio cables to it - could we put some microphones in the tall grass and it'll reach it.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nI suppose. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nGood to know. Okay - byeeeeeee\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nMakayla and Asher leave on bicycle. Dallas watches curiously and then peers at the swinging breeze of the tall grass. \r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 2: Dallas Night\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-night | File: 02_dallas-night.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas struggles to fall asleep in his new home. He hears strange noises from outside. As he looks out the window he sees a flicker of a faint gold light. \r\n\r\nCurious and wide awake - Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving supplies and a few pieces of furniture.\r\n\r\nHe hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers outside. Curious, he opens a box marked \"GENIVE.\"\r\n\r\nDallas pulls out a heavy, a bunch of old vanilla folders. military-grade desktop Oscillator, a portable audio recorder, an a portable Oscillator. In the bottom of the box, covered in dust, sumberged by cables,  Dallas finds and old pair of retro red headphones. \r\n\r\nOn one of the headphones, Dallas peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.\r\n\r\nThe photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.\r\n\r\nDallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.\r\n\r\nDallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.\r\n\r\nAs he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside.\r\n\r\nDallas walks to the window and attempts to record the readings, and just as it capturing something, the battery dies.  \r\n\r\nHe sets the receiver down and heads for the door.\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 3: The Hum\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: 03_the-hum.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. DALLAS HOUSE - DAY\r\nDallas walks outside and watches the tall grass sway in the wind. As he walks he notices a man approaching him from the sidewalk near his house. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC, early 40s, wearing a bright salmon covered short sleeve button up approaches Dallas with great vigor. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNeighbor!\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat's that?\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou are my neighbor - we saw you the other day driving by - did you just move here?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nOh - yeah.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNice. Names Dominic.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nDallas, what a cool name - - What you up to?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nI'm just walking into town - got to get some batteries.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat kind of batteries?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n9 Volt should work.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo you're walking into town?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou don't have a car?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNo - no car.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah. Me neither - well I share one with my sister, she's borrowing mine. I was about to go get it in town - there's a hardware store in Branford that could have those batteries. Want to walk together?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nEXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal scenes, and neighborhoods, and sidewalks. As they approach one in particular - a patch of tall marsh grass - Dallas stops.\r\n\r\nDallas, sheepishly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he pulls out a pocket recorder - and points it at the marsh.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat's with the gadget?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nOh, it's an audio recorder.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nBe careful - there are coyotes up in that.\r\n\r\nDallas continues to record.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nCome on champ. Hey - there's a fellowship lunch at my church today, CPC. You should come. Free food. We're going to be late though.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nEXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. The building looks closed. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou have got to be kidding me!\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nHe rips the ticket off and walks around to see if anyone is looking - and finds a secret key. \r\n\r\nAs Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.\r\n\r\nDominic opens the car and gestures Dallas to get in - non-chantanly the parking ticket in the glove box. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nHey you hungry?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(still in a daze)\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nGood - my church is doing a fellowship lunch - little picnic - I got to go bring the car there to my sister - but we'll eat first - no worries.  \r\n\r\nINT. CAR - DRIVING TO CPC\r\n\r\nDominic drives from Branford Town Center toward the church. Dallas in the passenger seat. Dallas looks out the window - almost as if he is trying to solve some mathamtical equation in his mind\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo where you from?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIndiana\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nIndiana - how'd you land up here in Branford? \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWork\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah? Where abouts\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYale?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNo - maybe - but for now Quinnipiac.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThat's refreshing.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nThey pull into the church lot. The fellowship lawn is ahead—picnic in full swing.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 4: Marsh Walk\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk | File: 04_marsh_walk.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER\r\n\r\nThe sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.\r\n\r\nDominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nSee this? Listen - those are *seagulls. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYour little toy showing you good results?\r\nThere’s a spot near the edge of the entrance creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 5: Marsh Trail\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk-later | File: 04_marsh_walk.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER\r\n\r\nThe sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.\r\n\r\nDominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nSee this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\n\r\nDallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.\r\n\r\nDominc\r\nWhat the heck is that?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIt's a portable Oscillator. It tells me what kind of low frequencies are in the air - to see if it is worth recording. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nSuit yourself. But lately - i've heard rumors that there's a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 6: News Vans & Trash Cans\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: 06_news_vans.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. BRANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic reach back to their neighborhood. Outside, nestled between their house, three news vans are parked haphazardly. \r\n\r\nDominic parks the car and the two get out to see. \r\n\r\nPAT CLENDENEN, MID 50s, is outside their house in front of news cameras. \r\n\r\nPAT CLENDENEN\r\n(to camera)\r\nThis afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. \r\n...and while we're all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday's festival, but folks, get those generators ready!\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic scoffs as they walk past.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nPat's been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nThe wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.\r\n\r\nEXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - LATER\r\n\r\nThey arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThose damn raccoons! I just put these out!\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at his front door, then at Dallas.\r\n\r\nDallas notices that there are some weird burn marks on the ground. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC (CONT'D)\r\nLook, I gotta clean this up and get the furniture moved before the men's group tonight. I got to go check on Mike and bring in another AC unit from the basement. You busy? \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(hesitates)\r\nSure. \n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 7: The Coordinates\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-coordinates | File: 07_the_coordinates.md*\n\n---\n\n\r\nINT. DOMINIC'S BASEMENT \r\nDallas and Dominic move an AC unit - as they go to install it - Dallas notices a strange burn mark on the ground near the tall grass. \r\n\r\nHe walks over to it and examines it - he brings out his oscillator and then begins to record it a bit. The readings are off.\r\n\r\nINT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe house smells like old wood and floor wax. Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall.\r\n\r\nAs they move - Dominic knocks over a photo frame - and Dallas grabs it. On the ground is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nMy wife and kid... Both gone now. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas sheepisly looks at Dominic.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat about you?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat do you mean?\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nHave you have someone that you've lost?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNo.\r\n\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic looks toward the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged fingernail.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC \r\nMr. Mike. I take care of him now. He's had a rough go since the weather changed... He doesn't like it at all. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic moves to the window and shuts the blinds halfway, like he's done it a thousand times. Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a gnarled finger at the window.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nShe's here! Hey Dominic! Look - she's here\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic dashes across the room to see what is going on - and then, once realizes - dashes for the door.  \r\n\r\nMr. Mike scratches faster. Dallas leans in and catches the numbers before Dominic blocks his view.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE \r\nForty-five left. Fifteen right. She's here - Dominic - Janice is here - ASHER! - it is playing the same frequencey Elena chased. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAsher writes the degrees on the back of his palm - far from the sight of Dominic or Janice. \r\n\r\nDallas freezes. Dominic flips the end table over—the scratchpad numbers disappear against the floorboards.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nDominic. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYes Mr. Mike\r\n\r\nMR.MIKE\r\nYour sister is here!\r\n\r\nINT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nThe front door slams open. JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. Behind her, ASHER (15) and MAKAYLA (22) trudge in, staring at their phones.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\n(spitting out keys)\r\nThe traffic on I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why aren't you cooking the sprouts already? We need to boil them first and then sear them. Last time you just boiled them and it was a disgusting mush... Hi Dallas. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou got it Janice. Anything for the brussels.  \r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nOkay.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\n\r\nJanice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas's heavy receiver on the floor.\r\n\r\nJANICE \r\nWhat is this? A boat anchor?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIt's a receiver. For work.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nMr. Mike in the distance begins to get agitated\r\n\r\nMR. Mike\r\nAnd when you hurt one - eventually they will transform into the other one - they wont stay kind forever. If the winds get them - they will take charge.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nJanice walks over and grabs Howie from the car and hands them to Dallas.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nDo you mind watching Howie for a bit this afternoon - I have to take everyone to costco\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas looks at the dog - the dog Howie looks back at the man Dallas. Makayla walks over and grabs the portable Oscillator holding in Dallas' hand. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nHave you given any thought to what I asked you the other day?\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDallas looks at Makayla and back at Asher\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nLet my brother borrow it. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAsher walks over to Mr. Mike to see how he is doing. Makayla approaches Dallas even further. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nDoes it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nAsher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n(yelling from the door)\r\nEveryone in the car! We're going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!\r\n\r\nThe family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 8: Dallas Marsh Walk\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-marsh-walk | File: 08_dallas_marsh_walk.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - EVENING\r\n\r\nDallas walks home with Howie. \r\n\r\nDallas walks with Howie along the coastal trail. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the tall grass. He carries his portable receiver, the dials clicking softly as he adjusts the frequency.\r\n\r\nThe air is still, too still. No birds. No wind. Just the distant sound of unseen water lapping against the shore.\r\n\r\nDallas steps off the boardwalk onto a narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh.\r\n\r\nThere in the distance he sees a distubrance. He walks over to a makeshift trap with a trailcam over it. He notices that it is wired to a solar pack and away from itself. Howie runs up to it and smells it. \r\n\r\nEXT. MARSH ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas stops at the creek's edge and pans his gaze towards the outer marsh. The tall grass stretches endlessly before him, golden-yellow reeds swaying gently despite the lack of wind.\r\n\r\nHis equipment begins to beep. Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern.\r\n\r\nHowie begins to bark a little - and Dallas stops him \r\nHe clicks \"Record,\" then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy.\r\n\r\nFrom the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas notices it—but it's gone.\r\n\r\nDallas takes a step forward, then another. The reeds part before him, closing behind him as he disappears into the tall grass.\r\n\r\nEXT. TALL GRASS - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through, his receiver spiking with each step. The hum grows louder, more insistent.\r\n\r\nHe stops. Listens. Something is moving in the grass ahead of him—something large, moving against the wind.\r\n\r\nHe stands slowly, scanning the reeds around him. Nothing. Just the gentle sway of grass and the sound of his own breathing.\r\n\r\nDallas turns and begins to make his way back, the receiver still recording, still searching for a signal that has vanished as quickly as it appeared.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 9: Dallas Night Work\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-night-work | File: 09_dallas_home_night.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT.

Hey - tomorrow - Listen - we got a free picnic - we should all go.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat time\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nAround 3 - or 4 - or 5 - not sure - but I'll ring you - we'll go.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nSounds good.\r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic picks back Howie up.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS DESK - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas is peered over his computer and begins to look at the recordings of the day. \r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS' HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas is home. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.\r\n\r\nHe listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(to himself)\r\nThere.\r\n\r\nHe replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. He's not just listening anymore—he's fitting pieces together.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(whispering)\r\nForty-five left. Fifteen right.\r\n\r\nHe stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.\r\n\r\nAnother burst hits the receiver—deeper, longer. The windows don't rattle yet, but Dallas feels it in his chest. He doesn't look up. He keeps writing. Equations. Approximations. The beginning of a map only he can hear.\r\n\r\nOutside, the marsh is dark. Inside, Dallas is wide awake, chasing a signal into the margins.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 10: The Fellowship\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: fellowship | File: 10_fellowship.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT.

Children are running, friends in light summerwear play spike ball, and people are on line getting food. Dallas looks around at all of the new faces but does not make eye contact. Dominic takes a deep breath, also appearing a little nervous. \r\n\r\nDominic carries a package of water and puts it under one of the fold up tables. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nAlright buddy - let's wait on line I guess. \r\n\r\n(action)\r\nDominic and Dallas wait on line to be served at fellowship lunch. \r\n\r\nJanice, Mid 50s, puts her hand on Dominic's shoulder.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSister.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nBrother.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThis is Dallas.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nHello.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nHey Dallas.

Makayla taps Asher on the shoulder and nods towards a far end of the church lawn. Between the bushes and garden. \r\n\r\nThe two leave the line for food and walk over to it. Dallas watches.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nSo what happened Dominic. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah - and it had a ticket.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nHow much. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nA good amount. \r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nThat's great. \r\n\r\nJanice leaves the line of food.\r\n\r\nDallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted, listening.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo, what are you here for?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWork.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nAt Yale?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nQuinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat kind of work?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nBioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh—birds, insects, coyotes. I start next semester.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNice. So are you here alone?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nOkay cool. That's cool.\r\n\r\nThey finish eating.

The tall grass doesn't just sway; it pulses in time with the sound.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(whispering)\r\nThat's not the wind.\r\n\r\nHowie lets out a low, whimpering growl and tugs hard on the leash, pulling Dallas back toward the safety of the porch.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 12: Howie Walk (Edge of Marsh)\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: howie-walk-2 | File: 12_howie_walk.md*\n\n---\n\nINT.

They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships.\r\n\r\nHe touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long, desperate.\r\n\r\nThe hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames.\r\n\r\nA doorbell is heard off screen breaking Dallas out of his trance. \r\n\r\nINT.

MARSH TRAIL - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas walks the coastal trail with Howie. Suddenly, the air vibrates. A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds.\r\n\r\nDallas and Howie step onto the narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh. \r\n\r\nAs they walk - the air changes into damp, metallic, stillness.\r\n\r\nEXT. MARSH ENTRANCE\r\n\r\nDallas and Howie stop at the creek's edge and pan glances towards the outer marsh.\r\n\r\nHowie's ears perk and he begins to gently whine, pressing against Dallas's leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. \r\n\r\nDallas crouches and lifts him, holding Howie a moment longer than necessary as he catches his breath. Howie's breathing begins to quicken. Dallas steadies him, resting his forehead briefly against Howie as he steadies him. \r\n\r\nFrom the distance a light flickers deep in the marsh. Dallas notices it - but it is gone. \r\n\r\nDallas lowers Howie to the ground and his equipment begins to beep. \r\n\r\nDallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern. \r\n\r\nDallas clicks \"Record,\" then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy. He is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.\r\n\r\nHis handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it's a repeating, melodic pattern.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(to Howie)\r\nStay here.\r\n\r\nHe ties Howie's leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.\r\n\r\nEXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nThe reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves. \r\n\r\nA cry rings out. It's not a throat-sound; it's air being forced through something hollow.\r\n\r\nDallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.\r\n\r\nA flickering glow emanates from its neck. Its \"back-holes\"—delicate vents along its spine—vibrate as it breathes, creating the sound that syncs perfectly with Dallas's receiver.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 16: The Burn Mark\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: the-burn-mark-2 | File: 16_the_burn_mark.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT.

As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.\r\n\r\nHe notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.\r\n\r\nAs Dallas lifts the fragile thing toward his chest, it looks out and cries for the crystal—in vain. It faints. The scope in his pocket goes silent.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the reeds—something massive, rocketing through the blades like an arrow. Dallas grabs the creature into his coat and rushes out. Howie does not like this. He freaks out.

Something heavy is slicing through the reeds, rocketing toward him like an arrow.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n\r\n(to himself)\r\n\r\nGo, go, go.\r\n\r\nHe breaks into a sprint, stumbling over hidden roots. He reaches the cedar tree. Howie is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass. Dallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is a hundred yards behind them.\r\n\r\nHe stops at the edge of his driveway, gasping for air. He looks down at his coat.

When the creature is calm, it emits a low, melodic tone through the holes in its back. HOWIE barks from the corner.

DALLAS'S BASEMENT - SAME TIME\r\n\r\nDallas shuffles through a pile of old equipment—mono cables, spare parts. The creature doesn't look like it's doing much. It's breathing, slightly. Dallas struggles to find a bed for it. He settles on an old shoebox—pauses when he sees his wife's handwriting on one, sets that aside—and gently nestles the creature inside. Its little feet curl tightly. It breathes slowly.\r\n\r\nHe finds a way to poke a hole in something so it can drink. MAKAYLA and ASHER watch from the staircase. Makayla comes down. She takes out the crystal. It begins to glow. Her hair lifts. She and the creature seem to communicate—a beat of shared attention. The creature's glow dims as she pulls her hand away.\r\n\r\nINT.

I think that cat's just sleeping. We could check after?\r\n\r\nAn elderly woman nods. Everyone agrees. Someone asks how Howie is doing—where is Howie. JOSH, one of the young couples, leads the group. He starts an opening ice breaker. Dallas, Dominic, Makayla, and Asher sit silent.\r\n\r\nTYLER, a young man with a guitar, hands out music sheets.\r\n\r\nTYLER\r\nSomething to settle the nerves.

Dallas ignores their presence, focused on the creature. Everyone's eyes widen. The creature wakes up. It goes into an almost frozen state—as if it's operating on a different timeline.\r\n\r\nDallas excuses himself. He needs air.\r\n\r\nMakayla gently places the sugar cube near the creature.

DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas stands alone. In a trance. He looks out at the tall grass for a long time. He slowly turns a dial on the receiver. The hum shifts. Almost instantly, something moves deep in the grass. Dallas freezes. He returns the dial to the previous setting. The movement stops.\r\n\r\nDominic comes outside.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWind's picking up.\r\n\r\nDallas doesn't answer. He's still staring at the grass.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - LATER\r\n\r\nThe room is sparse. Chairs pushed aside. The crew has decided: they'll take it back. Drop it off where they found it.\r\n\r\nDominic, Makayla, and Asher discuss the plan. Dallas stares blankly, half listening. The hum is back. It fills the silence.\r\n\r\nThey are the last to leave. Dominic herds the kids toward the door. Dallas stays by the window a moment longer. Then he follows. The house empties. The creature remains in the basement—for now.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 24: Creature Missing\n\n*ACT II — The Creature | ID: creature-missing | File: 24_creature_missing.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - HALL / DEN - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas is wide awake. Candle shadows dance across the hall. He checks a small video feed of the creature in the den downstairs—temperature, frequency of the earth, the hum of the box. He picks up the tape recorder. Presses play.\r\n\r\nHis late wife's voice. Her theories. The great hum—something she read about as a girl. A long narration. Why she had to stop. He listens. He goes to bed with her voice still in his head.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT (SAME)\r\n\r\nDallas looks out the tall window toward the marsh. In the distance: a pair of eyes. Bright. Dim. Bright. Red. He looks across the street—the telephone pole has a red light. Something down the block glows red. He looks back at the tall grass. The red eyes are gone.\r\n\r\nHe looks again. Closer. The eyes reappear. Swirling through the blades of grass. Watching the house. Little pulses of red light. Inch by inch. Closer to the edge of the yard.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT / DEN - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas makes his way downstairs to check on the creature. The makeshift box is empty. The creature is gone.\r\n\r\nEXT.

The night is still.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n## ACT III — The Return\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 25: Marsh Confrontation\n\n*ACT III — The Return | ID: marsh-confrontation | File: 25_marsh_confrontation.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - DAY (NEXT MORNING OR LATER)\r\n\r\nDallas rushes downstairs. HOWIE whimpers at his heels. He reaches the shoebox. It's empty. The window above is unlatched. Swinging in the wind.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME\r\n\r\nJANICE gets out of her car and stops. Her minivan is covered in strange, scorched patterns—burn marks. She pulls out her phone. Takes a photo. Scrapes one mark with her key.\r\n\r\nASHER stands beside her. He follows the trail with his eyes. Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows. A path. Something left. Something came for the creature.\r\n\r\nASHER\r\nMom. Look.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nDallas! What is happening to my car?\r\n\r\nShe can't find him. Inside, Dallas is already in the backyard—staring at the marsh with his oscillator. The creature is gone. The bad things are calling it back. The trail of burn marks points the way.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 26: Predator Attack\n\n*ACT III — The Return | ID: predator-attack | File: 26_predator_attack.md*\n\n---\n\nINT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE barges through the front door. MAKAYLA chases after him.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nWhere is it? Where is it?\r\n\r\nHe searches the kitchen, the hall, haphazard. Makayla makes desperate eye contact with DALLAS, who is by the window with his equipment.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME\r\n\r\nJANICE gets out of her car and stops. Strange burn marks run along the minivan's panels. She pulls out her phone, takes a photo, then scrapes one mark with her key.\r\n\r\nASHER, beside her, follows the trail with his eyes. Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows.\r\n\r\nASHER\r\nMom. Look.\r\n\r\nJanice can't find Dallas. Inside, he's in the backyard, staring at the marsh with his oscillator. He moves a pole slightly and checks the read again.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nMakayla watches from a distance. She walks over, picks up another pole, and plants it. She adjusts a wire. Dallas's reading on the handheld jumps. He looks over. A beat. He acknowledges her.\r\n\r\nThey work in silence—digging, planting poles, stringing wire. A makeshift fence taking shape around the edge of the property.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWhat happened?\r\n\r\nDallas doesn't answer. Makayla reads his face.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nThe creature?\r\n\r\nDallas nods. Makayla grabs his device off the table. DOMINIC appears and grabs her wrist. The three of them stand there. From the direction of the marsh—a cry. Distant, unmistakable. The creature. Then the hum, low and everywhere.\r\n\r\nMakayla turns to Dallas.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWe have to go get it back. The bad creatures want to kill it.\r\n\r\nDallas looks at the tall grass. At the reading. At her. Then toward the house—Howie. They grab him and start down the trail.\r\n\r\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER\r\n\r\nDallas, Makayla, and Howie push through the reeds. The same glow they saw before—flickering, faint. They rush toward it. The trail leads toward the salt marsh. As they inch closer, they see them: a group of creatures, birdlike and small, gathered in a loose circle. They are attending to the injured one—the one from the shoebox. Gentle, urgent.\r\n\r\nDallas and Makayla slow. Howie whines. The creatures have not yet scattered. For a moment, it looks like help. Like a family.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 27: The Perimeter\n\n*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-perimeter | File: 27_the_perimeter.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. SALT MARSH - DAY (CONTINUOUS)\r\n\r\nThe younger creatures—two or three—scatter. The elders lift their hands. From their backs, a fine mist sprays out.\r\n\r\nDallas and Makayla stiffen. Their bodies are no longer their own. The hum rolls over them. They are walking backward, away from the circle, step by step. Howie whines, pulled with them.\r\n\r\nMore lights appear. Dozens of golden glows rise like lanterns in the mist. Then the red eyes. They multiply at the edge of the reeds, contrasting with the gold.\r\n\r\nThe red eyes begin to circle the golden ones. One by one, in a blur—the mind fills in a predator pouncing—they snatch the lights. The red-eye creatures don't hum. They cancel. Sound disappears the way shadow erases light.\r\n\r\nMore predators emerge. For every inch they creep, shadow climbs the tall grass. The paralysis holding Dallas and Makayla seems to come from the elders—a last effort to protect the humans—but the elders are no match. The red eyes blink. The small creatures huddle in terror.\r\n\r\nDallas and Makayla move slowly at first, then break into a brisk walk back the way they came. Dallas glances back.\r\n\r\nIn the distance: the tiny creature. Its pulse blinks large once—then dims. An awful sound of gnashing. Something has it.\r\n\r\nDallas stops. He pulls out the dial. He turns it. The creature's pulse flares again. The predators retract. In that split second, Dallas runs forward, grabs the creature, and runs.\r\n\r\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas runs with the creature in his coat. He stops. Looks down. The creature has stopped pulsing. It is motionless. He sets it down. Other golden pulses gather around it. The hum drops—lower and lower on the bass scale.\r\n\r\nDallas backs away. Makayla and Howie are already at the edge of the grass. He catches up. They don't look back. They make their way out of the tall grass.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 28: The Last Dinner\n\n*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-last-dinner | File: 28_the_last_dinner.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. EDGE OF TALL GRASS - DAY\r\n\r\nThe crew watches from a distance. In the marsh: a battle of pulse and shadow. The red-eyed creatures surround the small ones. They devour them. A mirage of flickering yellow lights against the red. Then it all stops.\r\n\r\nThe bad creatures turn. They seek the humans.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nRun.\r\n\r\nThey run out of the tall grass and don't stop until they're home.\r\n\r\nEXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATER\r\n\r\nDallas sits in the kitchen, silent. Then he gets up. No debate. He goes outside and starts digging.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas jams heavy poles into the mud. He takes copper wire and hangs it between them. He pauses, moves one pole back a few feet, checks the meter again.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA paces the distance between poles with heel-to-toe steps. The tone on the receiver drops—spreading wider but losing strength.\r\n\r\nASHER gives Dominic a tour of the equipment, explaining what each component does. Asher reaches for the dial, then pulls his hand back when it squeals.\r\n\r\nThe storm rolls in. Makayla runs toward JANICE. Mr. Mike, Asher, and Dominic are outside. Dallas looks stunned, staring into the tall grass. He keeps going—poles, wire. Dominic, without a word, begins to help him.\r\n\r\nDallas examines the perimeter. A small radio plays—PAT CLENDENEN from the news van, welcoming Branford to a beautiful southern New England morning. The contrast is cruel.\r\n\r\nDallas jams the last pole into the mud. The crew stare at the tall grass. The decision is unspoken: leave the creature. Dallas and Makayla dig. Soon: the crawl of fire engines in the distance. Sea birds. And then the hum.\r\n\r\nDallas walks back to the house. The crew follows. They wait on the porch. The perimeter is up. The storm is here.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThis is crazy. What are we doing here.\r\n\r\nNo one answers.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n## ACT IV — Aftermath\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 29: Final Echoes\n\n*ACT IV — Aftermath | ID: final-echoes | File: 29_final_echoes.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATE DAY (STORM)\r\n\r\nThe sun sets. The crew peer out at the yard and the tall grass.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nLet's have some dinner.\r\n\r\nHe wipes the counter hard. A cup tips over. Mr. Mike nods from his chair.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nGood time to eat.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDominic and Asher cook. Makayla and Dallas share a glance at the window—Dallas watching the weather, the perimeter, the grass.\r\n\r\nThey eat standing, plates in hand, taking turns at the window. Outside, the noise grows. Sniffs. Gnarls. The creatures. Makayla rattles in her chair, impatient.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWhat should we do?\r\n\r\nDominic looks defeated. Dallas says nothing. Mr. Mike rocks in his chair, muttering. He taps the same three beats on the armrest, over and over.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nOne-one-five point three. One-one-five point three.\r\n\r\nDominic is hesitant. He asks Dallas for answers about the field. Dallas doesn't have them. Dominic argues they should focus on boarding up the house for the storm.\r\n\r\nAs he speaks—Makayla bolts. She runs out the back door, cutting across the yard toward the reeds before anyone can grab her.\r\n\r\nThe sound spikes once. Sharper. Shorter. Then it cuts.\r\n\r\nMakayla snatches the crystal from her pocket and sprints. Dominic chases her. He can't reach her in time. He hesitates at the edge of the tall grass. He cries her name. Asher and Dallas reach the grass and stare.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas powers on the makeshift poles. Howie cowers next to him. Mr. Mike watches from the window. Dominic rushes past for flashlights. He tries to call Makayla on the two-way radio—Asher has the other walkie. Dominic tells Dallas to watch Mr. Mike and Howie. He hesitates, then heads into the grass.\r\n\r\nDallas waits with Howie on the porch. He watches his equipment. The blinking orange light turns green. He hurries over to inspect. The indicator: green, then orange pulses.\r\n\r\nThe storm approaches. The two of them pace. Mr. Mike, inside, hears the thunder and yells.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nThey're coming! They're coming!\r\n\r\nDallas secures the fence. A distant cry. Then the low hum. Night falls. The winds pick up. Eyes circulate in the fields. Dominic grabs Dallas's sleeve. Dallas pulls free without turning around.\r\n\r\nDallas brings Howie inside. He sets the leash on the hook like he'll be back in a minute. He rubs Howie's face. Leaves the porch light on. Then he heads out to the tall grass.\r\n\r\nEXT. TALL GRASS - NIGHT\r\n\r\nA strange silence engulfs Dallas despite the wind. He sees a glimmer of fading light and moves toward it. The sensation of being watched almost overwhelms him. He keeps going.\r\n\r\nHe stops. Pulls a crumpled napkin from his pocket. Opens it: 45 L 15 R. It matches his equipment. The compass on the device.\r\n\r\nIn the distance: Makayla, holding one of the creatures. Asher and Dominic sit next to her, dazed. Makayla's eyes are fading as Dallas approaches. In her hands, the creature makes its calls. Little by little, dark eyes appear around them. Another creature of the same size emerges and begins to nurture the one she holds.\r\n\r\nDallas makes contact with the creature. The creature begins to sing. The crew are paralyzed—and so are the dark forces. They cower away. The storm rages. The creatures retreat into their holes in the gnarls of the soft trees.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT / DAWN\r\n\r\nDallas, Dominic, and Makayla sit by the window and watch for the night to end. It does.\r\n\r\nEXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - MORNING\r\n\r\nMorning. Dallas is still making calculations. Then he stops. He puts his equipment in the trash. The crew leaves. Dallas is alone again.\r\n\r\nHe looks outside. The soft sound—the pulse of the creature—returns. Faint. There. He listens.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 30: Aftermath\n\n*ACT IV — Aftermath | ID: aftermath | File: 30_aftermath.md*\n\n---\n\nEXT. BRANFORD - DAY\r\n\r\nThe town is back to normal. People move through their routines. The strange occurrences of the last few days are still on everyone's lips—muted, half-disbelieved.\r\n\r\nINT. TV STUDIO / NEWS SET - DAY\r\n\r\nPAT CLENDENEN at the anchor desk. Behind him, a window or screen shows southern New England—fog, clearing skies.\r\n\r\nPAT CLENDENEN\r\nThe Nor'easter's last-second shift—call it an unlikely miracle. Either way, a good safety warning. This town's prepared now.\r\n\r\nBehind him, in the background fog, a faint red-pulsing eye appears. One moment. Then it's gone.\r\n\r\nEXT. CHURCH GROUNDS - DAY\r\n\r\nA church event. Picnic tables. Nica's catered lunch. DOMINIC and DALLAS greet each other. They don't talk much. They sit next to each other. Eat. Still don't talk much.\r\n\r\nIn the distance: ASHER and MAKAYLA. They're crouched near the playground, watching something small. Makayla pulls a jar from her bag. A tiny caterpillar. She eases it inside. They're building little devices of their own—wires, batteries, scraps. This is just the start of the creature adventure. They don't say it. It's in the way they move.\r\n\r\nDallas watches them. He doesn't say anything.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S WORKSHOP / HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas at his desk. The tape recorder plays his late wife's voice. He fiddles with a recording mechanism. Wires. A modified receiver. He finally gets it working. He hits record. From outside, the hum from the tall grass bleeds into the room. He listens. He begins to sketch—notations, marks. An alphabet. Something to capture it.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas goes to bed. The device sits on the nightstand. He hears echoes. Something beyond the shadows he saw before. He lies there. Listening.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - MORNING\r\n\r\nJANICE pulls up. She gets out. She and Dallas hug. She hands him HOWIE's leash. Dallas greets the little dog with real affection. They stare at each other for a while. Howie's ears twitch. He's disturbed by something out in the tall grass. Dallas looks at his watch. Then toward the creek.\r\n\r\nEXT. CREEK BEND - DAY\r\n\r\nThe place where the lawn becomes reed. The same bend from before. Dallas stops. He lifts the receiver. He tunes the dial. The hum rises, falls. He adjusts again. The dial clicks into place. He stands there. Recording. The tall grass moves. He doesn't move. He listens.\r\n\n\n---\n\n";
