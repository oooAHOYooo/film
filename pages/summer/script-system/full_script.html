DALLAS NEW HOUSE - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas stares at the Tall Grass outside his house as he unloads boxes from a big pile. Dallas scans the new backyard, there are some old rusty lawn furtniture and a picnic table that seems to be adjacent to a fence of grass \r\n\r\nDallas goes into the grass a little bit and as he does he notices that there is a makeshift trap - a small rig of a stick. Upon further examination he notices that it is not a trap but a recording device of sorts. \r\n\r\nAs Dallas examines he hears a distinct bicycle ring.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA, 22 and ASHER, 14 - approach on bikes. They watch him for a while.\r\n\r\nThey approach Dallas slowly as one of the boxes draws their curiousity. Makayla watches Dallas pull out a military grade Oscillator.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\n(to Asher but loud enough for Dallas to hear)\r\nYou know that could be used to track the baseline difference between the cry of the BinzoBee and the howl of the Ophragah.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nAsher nods. Makayla approaches Dallas. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nHey mister. \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYes?\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nIs that an Oscillator?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYes. \r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nMakayla looks at Asher and whispers something in his ear. He nods. She returns glances to Dallas and inches her bike closer. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nDo you think my brother Asher could borrow it some time? \r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nDallas looks at the Oscillator and then at Makayla and Asher\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nHe needs it to gather evidence.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat kind of evidence? \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nTell him Asher. \r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nAsher stands silent in a sheepish shyness.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nDoes it work?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIt does - but you need a power source. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWhat if we connect audio cables to it - could we put some microphones in the tall grass and it'll reach it.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nI suppose. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWhat if I found a weird stone that pulses when storms approach - would it pick that up?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nI'm not sure.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWell okay. Asher do you have any questions. \r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nMakayla turns to Asher. He shakes his head no. \r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nOkay then. Byeeeeeee.\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 01 file: s01.md nickname: arrival -->\n\n(action)\nMakayla and Asher peddle their bikes away. Dallas watches curiously and then peers at the swinging breeze of the tall grass. \r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 2: Dallas Night\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-night | File: s02.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 02 file: s02.md nickname: dallas-night -->\n\n<!-- nickname: dallas-night -->\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas struggles to fall asleep in his new home. He hears strange noises from outside. As he looks out the window he sees a flicker of a faint gold light. \r\n\r\nCurious and wide awake - Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving supplies and a few pieces of furniture.\r\n\r\nHe hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers through his living room window. \r\n\r\nDallas looks back at a pile of unopened boxes in the middle of his living room. He hestitates but makes his way towards a box marked \"Sierra\".\r\n\r\nDallas pulls out a heavy, a bunch of old vanilla folders, another military-grade desktop Oscillator, a portable audio recorder, an a portable Oscillator. \r\n\r\nOne of the folders slips open as he lifts it—inside, a glimpse of hand-drawn sketches and a tab labeled \"FIELD NOTES — BRANFORD 2004.\" Dallas closes it without looking and sets the stack aside.\r\n\r\nIn the bottom of the box, covered in dust, sumberged by cables,  Dallas finds and old pair of retro red headphones.\r\n\r\nOn one of the headphones, Dallas peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.\r\n\r\nThe photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.\r\n\r\nDallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.\r\n\r\nDallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.\r\n\r\nAs he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside. The sound is faint and he listens\r\n\r\nDallas walks to the window and attempts to record the readings, and just as it capturing something, the battery dies. \r\n\r\n\r\nScrambling, Dallas looks through his box of equipment for other devices but they all take C batteries. \r\n\r\nDallas, fustrated, throws down the equipment and heads for the door. \r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas stands alone watching the tall grass sway agaisnt the salt breeze. The hum seems to be decreasing in scale and size as the night disappears into the distance of the tall marsh grass.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas struggles to go to sleep. As he hears more faint cries he looks out the window and sees a faint golden glow again. \n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 3: The Hum\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: the-hum | File: s03.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->\n\n<!-- nickname: the-hum -->\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NEXT DAY MORNING\r\nDallas walks outside his house, towards the edge of the property. As he approaches the edge of his yard he watches the tall grass sway in the wind. He looks at the grass for a beat too long, as he nurses the C battery in his hand. As he does so, he becomes dazed.\r\n\r\nA faint hum is heard off in the distance of the tall grass - low from the earth. Dallas looks at his watch and begins clicking with his hand. And then he writes down some numbers on a sticky note. \"3, 5, 1\" \r\n\r\nAs Dallas focuses, he notices a man approaching him from the sidewalk near his house. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC AMARANTO, early 40s, wearing a bright salmon covered short sleeve button up approaches Dallas with great vigor. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNeighbor!\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWhat's that?\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou are my neighbor - we saw you the other day driving by - did you just move here?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nOh - yeah.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNice. Names Dominic.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nDallas.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nDallas, what a cool name - - What you up to?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nI'm just walking into town - got to get some batteries.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nOh yeah? Where abouts?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNot sure, I was just going to go to the hardware store. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo you're walking into town?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYeah.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou don't have a car?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNo - no car.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah. Me neither - well I share one with my sister, she's borrowing mine. I was about to go  - there's a hardware store in Branford that could have those batteries. Would you like to tag along?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nSure.\r\n\r\nEXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal sidewalks, neighborhoods, and natural marsh fences. As they approach one patch of tall marsh grass in particular, Dallas stops.\r\n\r\nDallas, sheepishly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he mumbles to himself. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nBe careful - there are coyotes up in that. Some people say the noises are from owls - but I know its coyotes. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. \r\n\r\nINT. HARDWARE STORE\r\n<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->\n\n(action)\nDominic waves to the unfriendly man at the counter and brings Dallas to the battery section. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo where you from?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIndiana.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nINDIANAAAA - how'd you land up here in Branford?\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->\n\n(action)\nDallas finds the correct batteries and grabs it off the shelf. \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWork.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah? Where abouts? Yale?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nQuinipiac. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThat's refreshing... What are you doing with Quinipiac\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nMostly field and bioacoustics. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe building looks closed. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou got to be kidding me!\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->\n\n(action)\nHe rips the ticket off and walks around to see if anyone is looking - and finds a secret key. \r\n\r\nAs Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.\r\n\r\nThe streetlight above them flickers. Once. Twice. Then steadies. Dallas watches it for a beat, then looks back at the birds.\r\n\r\nDominic opens the car and gestures Dallas to get in - non-chantanly the parking ticket in the glove box. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYou hungry?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(still in a daze)\r\nYeah\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nGood -  my church is doing a fellowship lunch - little picnic - I got to go to the bakery and bring a tray. You should come. \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nSure. \r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 03 file: s03.md nickname: the-hum -->\n\n(action)\nDOMINIC\r\nNice - yeah - it's nice to be the new guy in town - good old branford. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 4: The Fellowship\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: fellowship | File: s04.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n<!-- nickname: fellowship -->\r\n\r\nEXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in heat of a picnic. Children are running, friends down light summerwear as they play spike ball, and church goers find themselvees are on a long line getting food. Dallas looks around at all of the new faces but does not make great eye contact. Dominic takes a deep breath and approaches the long line. \r\n\r\nDominic carries a package of water and puts it under one of the fold up tables. As he does so, people look at Dallas and begin to greet him. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nAlright buddy - let's wait on line I guess. \r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n(action)\nDominic and Dallas wait on line to be served at fellowship lunch. As they do people begin to turn around and talk to them. One lady, MARY, 55 turns around and shakes Dallas' hand enthustiaclly.\r\n\r\nMARY\r\nWell hey there sunshine\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nHello\r\n\r\nMARY\r\nDominic where did you get this Califorina boy from? My name is Mary - do you like chicken primevro?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNever really had it\r\n\r\nMARY\r\nWell you should, its great.... So you ready for some proper New England weather?\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n(action)\nAnother turns around and greets Dallas. An older gentleman PAUL WILDLY, 72, \r\n\r\nPAUL\r\nThe forecasters say that it is going to be historic one. Hasn't been this bad since 1977 - when Nixon was still in office. Paul, nice to meet you. \r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nNice to meet you.\r\n\r\nPAUL\r\nNow, where are you from?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nIndiana\r\n\r\nPAUL\r\nOo - then you must know of William Henry Harrison - our 9th president, served as Indiana's governor back when it was just a terriority. \r\n\r\nMARY\r\nPaul, stop that. Honey - if you need I can make you some chicken primevera\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nHe's okay Ms Mary thank you\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nThank you. \r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n(action)\nDallas and Dominic sit in a circle of folded pull up chairs. \r\n\r\nJANICE AMARANTO, Mid 50s, taps Dominic's shoulder.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSister.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nBrother. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n(ignoring Janice)\r\nDallas, these are my niece and nephew - Makayla and Asher.\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n(action)\nMakayla and Asher don't say much but wait online. Makayla taps Asher on the shoulder and nods towards a far end of the church lawn. Between the bushes and garden. \r\n\r\nThe two leave the line walk over to a corner spot by the end of the church yard and huddle over a pile of brush.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nSo what happened Dominic. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nYeah - and it had a ticket.\r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nHow much. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nA good amount. \r\n\r\nJANICE\r\nThat's great. \r\n\r\nJanice leaves the line of food.\r\n\r\nDallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted by what Makayla and Asher are looking at the distance. \r\n\r\nJanice, noticing that Dallas is a little quiet - tries to spark conversation. \r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nSo, what are you here for?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nWork.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nAt Yale?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nQuinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nWhat kind of work?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nBioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh—birds, insects, coyotes. I start next semester.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nNice. So are you here alone?\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nYep.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nOkay cool. That's cool.\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 04 file: s04.md nickname: fellowship -->\n\n(action)\nThey finish eating. The group begins to disperse. Janice walks over to Dallas and hands him Howie again. \r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 5: Marsh Trail\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: marsh-walk-later | File: s05.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 05 file: s05.md nickname: marsh-walk-later -->\n\n<!-- nickname: marsh-walk-later -->\r\n\r\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER\r\n\r\nThe sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.\r\n\r\nDominic and Dallas walk quietly for a while. Dominic looks out to the tall grass.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThe kids are always out here with their cameras.\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 05 file: s05.md nickname: marsh-walk-later -->\n\n(action)\nDominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\n\r\nSee this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 6: News Vans & Trash Cans\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: news-vans | File: s06.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->\n\n<!-- nickname: news-vans -->\r\n\r\nEXT. BRANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas and Dominic reach back to their neighborhood. Outside, nestled between their house, three news vans are parked haphazardly. \r\n\r\nDominic parks the car and the two get out to see. \r\n\r\nPAT CLENDENEN, MID 50s, is outside their house in front of news cameras. \r\n\r\nPAT CLENDENEN\r\n(to camera)\r\nThis afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. \r\n...and while we're all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. \n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\r\nWe're also getting reports of rolling brownouts along the Route 146 corridor—UI says it's weather-related surges, but they're sending a crew to check the Branford substation.\r\n\n\n</div>\n\n\r\nHopefully, it holds off until after Sunday's festival, but folks, get those generators ready!\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->\n\n(action)\nDominic scoffs as they walk past.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nPat's been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 06 file: s06.md nickname: news-vans -->\n\n(action)\nThe wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it.

They moved in a couple of months ago. I keep trying to get them to stay in the guestroom, but they just want to be living in the basement...

BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING\r\n\r\nThe Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the edge of his neighborhood.\r\n\r\nAs Howie, Dallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become. \r\n\r\nIt seems like the readings are pointing closer and closer to his house.\r\n\r\nHowie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.\r\n\r\nIn the far distance, a single coyote barks. Then another. A chain reaction of domestic fear starts in the neighborhood, followed by the high, thin yip of coyotes further inland.\r\n\r\nDallas pulls out his phone. A vibration and an alert for a STORM WARNING pops up.\r\n\r\nEXT. EDGE OF THE MARSH - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nEverything goes still. The wind stops. The waves seem to mute themselves.\r\n\r\nThen, the HUM begins.\r\n\r\nIt starts as a vibration in Dallas's teeth, then moves to his chest. It is a deep, dense, multi-layered sound—a living reed being forced through a massive throat.\r\n\r\nDallas stands in a daze, his hand tightening on Howie's leash. The tall grass pulses in time with the sound.\r\n\r\n\n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\r\nBehind him, the streetlights along the block go dark—all of them, at once. Three seconds of blackout. Then they snap back on, one by one, from the marsh outward, as if the power is being returned in sequence.\r\n\n\n</div>\n\n\r\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - EVENING\r\n\r\nDallas walks home with Howie. \r\n\r\nDallas walks with Howie along the coastal trail. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the tall grass. He carries his portable receiver, the dials clicking softly as he adjusts the frequency.\r\n\r\nDallas stops at the creek's edge and pans his gaze towards the outer marsh. The tall grass stretches endlessly before him, golden-yellow reeds swaying gently despite the lack of wind.\r\n\r\nThe air is still, too still. No birds. No wind. Just the distant sound of unseen water lapping against the shore.\r\n\r\nDallas steps off the boardwalk onto a narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh.\r\n\r\nThere in the distance he sees a distubrance. He walks over to a makeshift trap with a trailcam over it. He notices that it is wired to a solar pack and away from itself. \r\n\r\nHis equipment begins to beep. Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern.\r\n\r\nHowie begins to bark a little - and Dallas stops him. Dallas clicks \"Record,\" then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy.\r\n\r\nFrom the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas notices it—but it's gone.\r\n\r\nDallas takes a step forward, then another. The reeds part before him, closing behind him as he disappears into the tall grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 9: Dallas Night Work\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: dallas-night-work | File: s09.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 09 file: s09.md nickname: dallas-night-work -->\n\n<!-- nickname: the golden daze -->\r\n\r\nEXT. INSIDE THE TALL MARSH - SUNSET HOUR\r\n\r\nDallas stands slowly, scanning the reeds around him. Nothing. Just the gentle sway of grass and the sound of his own breathing.\r\n\r\nDallas steps deeper, following the fading glow. \r\n\r\nAll around him is light reeeds blowing in an almost whirlwind of light and color. \r\n\r\nShadows—tall, spindly, and darker than the night—grow in the distance. They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships.\r\n\r\nAs Dallas' eyes adjust to this new brightness - the world around him slowly fades back to normallacly. \r\n\r\nThere in the distance Dallas sees a gnarl tree that looks a little different than the rest of the trees. \r\n\r\nDallas approaches the tree and in the bottom of it - lives a small birdlike creature - gently bioluminest - and clearly injured. \r\n\r\nDallas looks at his equipment and it seems to do funny things when he is near it. Dallas gently wraps the creature in his jacket. \n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 10: Shadows in Wind\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: shadows-in-wind | File: s10.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 10 file: s10.md nickname: shadows-in-wind -->\n\n<!-- nickname: Creature discovery -->\r\n\r\nEXT. TALL GRASS - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\nDallas leaves with the creature \r\nDallas finds the creature. \r\n\r\n\r\nIn a shallow hollow, a cluster of bioluminescent creatures huddle around the gnarl of an old tree—little orbs of gold, pulsing like lanterns.\r\n\r\nAs Dallas approaches, the lights scatter into the reeds.\r\n\r\nOne remains. Smaller than the rest. Injured. It lets out a thin cry that makes the scope needle jump.\r\n\r\nDallas looks around. All at once the marsh is silent. The silence comes in waves—pressing, releasing.\r\n\r\nHe scoops the injured creature into his hands.\r\n\r\nThe air changes.\r\n\r\nA heavy, crushing sound slices through the reeds—something massive rocketing toward him like an arrow.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\n(to himself)\r\nGo, go, go.\r\n\r\nDallas breaks into a sprint. He reaches the stunted cedar tree—HOWIE is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass.\r\n\r\nDallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is far behind them.\r\n\r\nAt the edge of his driveway, he finally stops—gasping. The creature is motionless in his coat, but its neck glow pulses weak, fading amber.\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 11: Howie Walk (Edge of Marsh)\n\n*ACT I — Arrival & Discovery | ID: howie-walk-2 | File: s11.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 11 file: s11.md nickname: howie-walk-2 -->\n\n<!-- nickname: The Kitchen Hospital -->\r\nEXT. COSTAL NEIGHBORHOOD JOURNEY \r\nDallas is alone and the evening is getting dark. He dashes back through the coastal neighborhoods with the creature in his jacket - and urges the dog Howie to walk faster - who is not having a good time. Dallas rushes the creature over to the kitchen and upstairs to examine further. \r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS KITCHEN - DUSK\r\nDallas rushes to bring the creature inside. He grabs an aluminion pan and lines it with parchment paper. The creature seems to be asleep. \r\n\r\nHowie barks outside. Dallas rushes to grab him.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\r\nHowie is in the living room couch very nervous and peering out the window. The camera pans and finds alone with the creature trying to understand it as he observes its features with thick macro monoculars. \r\n\r\nAs Dallas peers closer, he notices that it has marks underneath its top wing. As Dallas touches the marks the creature suddenly wakes up and lets out a cry.\r\n\r\nAs the creature cries - Dallas notices that all of the screens on his equipment turn slowly into golden static. The hue gets so vibrant and bright that permant golden marks are left scattered across all of his equipment near the creature. \r\n\r\nThe creature lets out a final whimper and slowly falls back to sleep. Dallas - looks at the mark again, as its sparkles and then fades. \r\n\r\nOutside the hum begins again, reverbating the kitchen. \r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON\r\n\r\nDallas runs outside with his audio recording equipment in his hand. The hum is growing into a faint roar from the distant marsh. \r\n\r\nAs he begins to record - the hum ceases - and he notices that the creature inside is crying loudly. \r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER\r\n\r\nDallas approaches it - and notices that the creature, though still seemingly asleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS DESK - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas is peered over his computer and begins to look at the recordings of the day. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.\r\n\r\nDallas as he is reading on computer - is holding a little sringe of chemicals that he hopes will replinish the creature. \r\n\r\nHe listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.\r\n\r\nDallas plays a recording of Sierra's voice to soothe the creature only to hear her voice dissolve into the creature's ongoing frequency. \r\n\r\nHe replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. \r\n\r\nHe stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.\r\n\r\nHis elbow brushes the stack of Sierra's folders. One slides open—a corner of a sketch visible. Something with wings. He pushes it closed without looking. \r\n\r\nAs he is listening another burst hits the ongoing recording. Dallas looks up from his desk and peers outside. Another faint glow. \r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS KITCHEN\r\nDallas makes his way to the creature. \r\n\r\nDallas looks at the creature - who is appearing to be drinking water and eating the grass - but is still sleeping inside of a gnarl of the aquarium Dallas has obviously made for it. \r\n\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING\r\n\r\nDallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.\r\n\r\nDallas goes to look at the creature in his makeshift box. It is breathing. Dallas begins to examine all of the blood - it seems to have darkened. \r\n\r\nHe touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long.\r\n\r\nThe hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames. \n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\r\nThe overhead light dims—not a flicker, but a slow, steady drain, as if something is pulling the current out of the walls.

DALLAS'S HOUSE - HALL / DEN - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas is wide awake. Candle shadows dance across the hall. He checks a small video feed of the creature in the den downstairs—temperature, frequency of the earth, the hum of the box. He picks up the tape recorder sitting next to him on his desk. Presses play.\r\n\r\nHis late wife's voice. Her theories. The great hum—something she read about as a girl. A long narration. Why she had to stop. He listens.\r\n\r\n\n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\r\nAs the tape plays, Dallas's hand drifts to the stack of Sierra's folders beside the recorder. He opens one.

He looks across the street—the telephone pole has a red light. Something down the block glows red. He looks back at the tall grass. The red eyes are gone.\r\n\r\nHe looks again. Closer. The eyes reappear. Swirling through the blades of grass. Watching the house. Little pulses of red light. Inch by inch. Closer to the edge of the yard.\r\n\r\nDallas looks at the burn mark on his forearm - it begins to glow a bit - and then as it does - more howls in the distance engulf the screen.\r\n\r\nINT.

It seems to have increased in size and now is forming lines of darkness towards his house, not unlike a corrupt vein system. \r\n\r\nBurn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows. Makayla follows them. She does some quiet mental math and takes a deep breath.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nDoes one of your devices could it be reversed engineered to transmit the sound that you have been recording.\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 24 file: s24.md nickname: marsh-confrontation -->\n\n(action)\nDallas thinks for a moment but his face says it all.\r\n\r\nDALLAS\r\nI suppose. \r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 24 file: s24.md nickname: marsh-confrontation -->\n\n(action)\nA faint hum is heard off in the distance.

MAKAYLA'S FORT - LATE SUN\r\n\r\nMakayla and Asher and Dallas sit on a tree log among the Long Island Sound.

Makayla makes desperate eye contact with DALLAS, who is by the window with his equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nMakayla watches from a distance. She walks over. She doesn't ask permission. She picks up the second receiver and starts scanning frequencies alongside him. Dallas's reading on the handheld jumps. He looks over. A beat. He acknowledges her.\r\n\r\nThey work in silence—listening, adjusting, mapping the signal. Makayla pulls out Sierra's folder and cross-references a frequency notation with what's on screen. A match.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWhat happened?\r\n\r\nDallas doesn't answer. Makayla reads his face.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nThe creature?\r\n\r\n<!-- scene: 25 file: s25.md nickname: predator-attack -->\n\n(action)\nDallas nods. Makayla grabs his device off the table. DOMINIC appears and grabs her wrist. The three of them stand there. From the direction of the marsh—a cry. Distant, unmistakable. The creature. Then the hum, low and everywhere.\r\n\r\nMakayla pulls free. She turns to both of them. Her eyes dart in the direction of the tall grass on the edge of Dallas' yard. \r\n\r\nA beat. Dallas stares at her.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA (CONT'D)\r\nWe have to go back.\r\n\r\nDallas looks at the tall grass. At the reading. At her. Then toward the house—Howie. They grab him and start down the trail.\r\n\r\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER\r\n\r\nDallas, Makayla, and Howie push through the reeds. The same glow they saw before—flickering, faint. They rush toward it. \r\n\r\nThe trail leads toward the salt marsh. As they inch closer, they see them: a group of creatures, birdlike and small, gathered in a loose circle. They are attending to the injured one—the one from the shoebox. Gentle, urgent.\r\n\r\nDallas and Makayla slow. Howie whines. The creatures have not yet scattered. For a moment, it looks like help. Like a family.\r\n\n\n---\n\n\n### Scene 26: The Perimeter\n\n*ACT III — The Return | ID: the-perimeter | File: s26.md*\n\n---\n\n<!-- scene: 26 file: s26.md nickname: the-perimeter -->\n\n<!-- nickname: the-perimeter -->\r\n\r\nEXT. SALT MARSH - DAY (CONTINUOUS)\r\n\r\nThe younger creatures—two or three—scatter. The elders lift their hands. From their backs, a fine mist sprays out.\r\n\r\nDallas and Makayla stiffen. Their bodies are no longer their own. The hum rolls over them. They are walking backward, away from the circle, step by step. Howie whines, pulled with them.\r\n\r\nMore lights appear. Dozens of golden glows rise like lanterns in the mist. Then the red eyes. They multiply at the edge of the reeds, contrasting with the gold.\r\n\r\nThe red eyes begin to circle the golden ones. One by one, in a blur—the mind fills in a predator pouncing—they snatch the lights. The red-eye creatures don't hum. They cancel. Sound disappears the way shadow erases light.\r\n\r\n\n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\n(whispering, barely audible)\r\nThey're erasing the frequency. If there's nothing left to record, no one will ever know they existed.\r\n\n\n</div>\n\n\r\n\r\nMore predators emerge. For every inch they creep, shadow climbs the tall grass. The paralysis holding Dallas and Makayla seems to come from the elders—a last effort to protect the humans—but the elders are no match. The red eyes blink. The small creatures huddle in terror.\r\n\r\nDallas and Makayla move slowly at first, then break into a brisk walk back the way they came. Dallas glances back.\r\n\r\nThe dark shadow creatures engulf Dallas and Makayla in a chaos of light and fury - while this happens their shadow tentacles hit \r\n\r\nIn the distance: the tiny creature. Its pulse blinks large once—then dims. An awful sound of gnashing. Something has it.\r\n\r\nDallas stops. He pulls out the dial. He turns it. The creature's pulse flares again. The predators retract. In that split second, Dallas runs forward, grabs the creature, and runs.\r\n\r\nEXT. MARSH TRAIL - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas runs with the creature in his coat. He stops. Looks down. The creature has stopped pulsing. It is motionless. He sets it down. Other golden pulses gather around it. The hum drops—lower and lower on the bass scale.\r\n\r\nDallas backs away. Makayla and Howie are already at the edge of the grass. He catches up. They don't look back. They make their way out of the tall grass.\r\n\r\n<!-- nickname: final-echoes -->\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATE DAY (STORM)\r\n\r\nThe sun sets. The crew peer out at the yard and the tall grass.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nLet's have some dinner.\r\n\r\nHe wipes the counter hard. A cup tips over. Mr. Mike nods from his chair.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nGood time to eat.\r\n\r\nINT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDominic and Asher cook. Makayla and Dallas share a glance at the window—Dallas watching the weather, \n\n<div class=\"script-addition\">\n\n> addition\n\nthe equipment in the yard,\n\n</div>\n\n the grass.\r\n\r\nThey eat standing, plates in hand, taking turns at the window. Outside, the noise grows. Sniffs. Gnarls. The creatures. Makayla rattles in her chair, impatient.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA\r\nWhat should we do?\r\n\r\nDominic looks defeated. Dallas says nothing. Mr. Mike rocks in his chair, muttering. He taps the same three beats on the armrest, over and over.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nOne-one-five point three. One-one-five point three.\r\n\r\nDominic is hesitant. He asks Dallas for answers about the field. Dallas doesn't have them. Dominic argues they should focus on boarding up the house for the storm.\r\n\r\nAs he speaks—Makayla bolts. She runs out the back door, cutting across the yard toward the reeds before anyone can grab her.\r\n\r\nThe sound spikes once. Sharper. Shorter. Then it cuts.\r\n\r\nMakayla snatches the crystal from her pocket and sprints. Dominic chases her. He can't reach her in time. He hesitates at the edge of the tall grass. He cries her name. Asher and Dallas reach the grass and stare.\r\n\r\nEXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT\r\n\r\nDallas powers on the speakers and the oscillator. The trap hums to life—a low, steady broadcast aimed at the corridor between the equipment.\r\n\r\nHowie cowers next to him. Mr. Mike watches from the window. Dominic rushes past for flashlights. He tries to call Makayla on the two-way radio—Asher has the other walkie. \r\n\r\nDallas waits with Howie on the porch. He watches his equipment. The blinking orange light turns green. He hurries over to inspect. The indicator: green, then orange pulses.\r\n\r\nThe storm approaches. The two of them pace. Mr. Mike, inside, hears the thunder and yells.\r\n\r\nMR. MIKE\r\nThey're coming! They're coming!\r\n\r\nDallas checks the trap one last time—the speakers are holding, the sensor blinking steady between them.\r\n\r\nA distant cry. Then the low hum. Night falls. The winds pick up. Eyes circulate in the fields. Dominic grabs Dallas's sleeve. Dallas pulls free without turning around.\r\n\r\nDallas brings Howie inside. He sets the leash on the hook like he'll be back in a minute. He rubs Howie's face. Leaves the porch light on. Then he heads out to the tall grass.\r\n\r\nEXT. TALL GRASS - NIGHT\r\n\r\nA strange silence engulfs Dallas despite the wind. He sees a glimmer of fading light and moves toward it. The sensation of being watched almost overwhelms him. He keeps going.\r\n\r\nHe stops. Pulls a crumpled napkin from his pocket. Opens it: 45 L 15 R. It matches his equipment. The compass on the device.\r\n\r\nIn the distance: Makayla, holding one of the creatures. Asher and Dominic sit next to her, dazed. But Makayla isn't crying out. She isn't frozen. She is focused.\r\n\r\nIn her lap: Dallas's oscillator. She has it wired to the creature's back-holes with the alligator clips from the kitchen triage. Her fingers move across the dial with precision—adjusting, listening, adjusting again. The creature's golden pulse flickers in time with her tuning.\r\n\r\nShe is actively broadcasting—matching the creature's output frequency and amplifying it outward. The golden light around them strengthens. The dark shapes at the edge of the reeds hesitate.\r\n\r\nDallas stops. He watches her. This isn't the girl who asked \"What does that do?\" in the kitchen. She has mastered the tool he gave her.\r\n\r\nLittle by little, dark eyes appear around them. Another creature of the same size emerges and begins to nurture the one Makayla holds.\r\n\r\nDallas kneels beside her. He makes contact with the creature through his receiver. The creature begins to sing—and the oscillator catches the song, amplifies it, pushes it outward in a wave that rolls across the marsh.\r\n\r\nThe creature looks at Makayla and other creatures around it step forward. It reaches a small limb and touches the Crystal in her hand. Makayla gives it to her. The Crystal changes color - it stops glowing and settles into a rich amber solid. \r\n\r\nAnother creature chimes and the family reunites. \r\n\r\nMakayla looks down at the stone - no longer a crystal but \r\n\r\nThe crew are paralyzed—and so are the dark forces. The Red-Eyes don't just cower. They lock in place—stun-locked, the same phase cancellation Makayla designed at the gap. Total silence around the predators. Total stillness.\r\n\r\nMakayla glances down at the oscillator screen. The waveform is clean. Sharp. Unmistakable. She hits record.\r\n\r\nThe storm rages. The creatures retreat into their holes in the gnarls of the soft trees. The Red-Eyes unfreeze and scatter into the dark.\r\n\n\n</div>\n\n\r\n\r\nINT.

DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS\r\n\r\nDallas drags his equipment to the edge of the yard—the oscillator, the military receiver, two speakers he's wired in series. He positions them facing the marsh, angled toward each other, creating a narrow corridor between them. He checks the meter. Adjusts. Checks again.\r\n\r\nMAKAYLA watches. She walks over. She pulls Sierra's folder from her jacket. Points to a sketch—a waveform diagram with two opposing frequencies colliding.\r\n\r\n\r\nDallas studies her face. Then he adjusts the second speaker, widening the corridor by a foot. Makayla attaches a sensor between the speakers and wires it to Dallas's receiver. The trap is acoustic—invisible. No wall. Just two frequencies waiting to collide.\r\n\n\n</div>\n\n\r\n\r\nASHER gives Dominic a tour of the equipment.

Mr. Mike, Asher, and Dominic are outside. Dallas looks stunned, staring into the tall grass. Dominic, without a word, begins to help him position the equipment.\r\n\r\nDallas examines the trap. A small radio plays—PAT CLENDENEN from the news van, welcoming Branford to a beautiful southern New England morning. The contrast is cruel.\r\n\r\nThe crew stare at the tall grass. The trap is set—not a wall to hide behind, but a kill zone designed to catch a predator. Soon: the crawl of fire engines in the distance. Sea birds. And then the hum.\r\n\n\n</div>\n\n\r\n\r\nDallas walks back to the house. The crew follows. They wait on the porch. The storm is here.\r\n\r\nDOMINIC\r\nThis is crazy.
