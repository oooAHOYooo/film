It's breathing, slightly. Dallas struggles to find a bed for it. He settles on an old shoebox—pauses when he sees his wife's handwriting on one, sets that aside—and gently nestles the creature inside. Its little feet curl tightly. It breathes slowly.\n\n\nHe finds a way to poke a hole in something so it can drink. MAKAYLA and ASHER watch from the staircase. Makayla comes down. She takes out the crystal. It begins to glow. Her hair lifts. She and the creature seem to communicate—a beat of shared attention. The creature's glow dims as she pulls her hand away.\n\nINT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - LATER\n\nPeople mill and talk. Someone asks where Dallas is.\n\n\nDOMINIC\nWe found a little cat. Dallas is downstairs nursing it.\n\nA woman stands—early fifties, warm.\n\nWOMAN\nI'm a retired vet. I could take a look.\n\nDOMINIC\nI mean— no, that's okay. I think that cat's just sleeping. We could check after?\n\nAn elderly woman nods. Everyone agrees.

As the voices rise, the hum from the basement begins to rise with them.\n\nMR. MIKE barges through the front door with JANICE guiding him inside. \n\nMR. MIKE\nWhere is it?
