EXT. BRANFORD - DAY

The town is back to normal. People move through their routines. The strange occurrences of the last few days are still on everyone's lips—muted, half-disbelieved.

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE
<!-- [ADDITION] Replaced pole wreckage with equipment wreckage + recording payoff + legacy transfer -->
Dallas looks around at his property—the storm has scattered his equipment. Speakers knocked face-down in the mud. The oscillator on its side, screen cracked. But the sensor Makayla wired between them is still blinking. He picks it up. The screen shows a saved file: one clean recording.

He presses play. The sound fills the yard—alien, harmonic, unmistakable. The frequency of the golden creatures, captured clean. No noise. No interference. Just the song.

Dallas holds it for a long moment. He looks at the photo of Sierra on his receiver. Then he looks toward the church, where Makayla sits in the distance with the folder open.

He doesn't need to carry it alone anymore.

INT. TV STUDIO / NEWS SET - DAY

PAT CLENDENEN at the anchor desk. Behind him, a window or screen shows southern New England—fog, clearing skies.

PAT CLENDENEN
The Nor'easter's last-second shift—call it an unlikely miracle. Either way, a good safety warning. This town's prepared now.

Behind him, in the background fog, a faint red-pulsing eye appears. One moment. Then it's gone.

EXT. CHURCH GROUNDS - DAY

A church event. Picnic tables. Nica's catered lunch. DOMINIC and DALLAS greet each other. They don't talk much. They sit next to each other. Eat. Still don't talk much.

In the distance: ASHER and MAKAYLA. They're crouched near the playground, watching something small. Makayla pulls a jar from her bag. A tiny caterpillar. She eases it inside. They're building little devices of their own—wires, batteries, scraps. <!-- [ADDITION] Sierra's folder on the bench — legacy continues as science -->
On the bench next to them: Sierra's folder, open. They're cross-referencing her sketches with their own observations.
<!-- [/ADDITION] -->
This is just the start of the creature adventure. They don't say it. It's in the way they move. <!-- [ADDITION] -->The legacy continues—not as ghost stories, but as science.<!-- [/ADDITION] -->

Dallas watches them. He doesn't say anything.

INT. DALLAS'S WORKSHOP / HOUSE - DAY

Dallas at his desk. The tape recorder plays his late wife's voice. He fiddles with a recording mechanism. Wires. A modified receiver. He finally gets it working. He hits record. From outside, the hum from the tall grass bleeds into the room. He listens. He begins to sketch—notations, marks. An alphabet. Something to capture it.

INT. DALLAS'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dallas goes to bed. The device sits on the nightstand. He hears echoes. Something beyond the shadows he saw before. He lies there. Listening.

EXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - MORNING

JANICE pulls up. She gets out. She and Dallas hug. She hands him HOWIE's leash. Dallas greets the little dog with real affection. They stare at each other for a while. Howie's ears twitch. He's disturbed by something out in the tall grass. Dallas looks at his watch. Then toward the creek.

EXT. CREEK BEND - DAY

The place where the lawn becomes reed. The same bend from before. Dallas stops. He lifts the receiver. He tunes the dial. The hum rises, falls. He adjusts again. The dial clicks into place. He stands there. Recording. The tall grass moves. He doesn't move. He listens.
