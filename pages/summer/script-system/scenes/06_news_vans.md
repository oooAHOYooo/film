This afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. 

...and while we’re all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday’s festival, but folks, get those generators ready!
