EXT. BRANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

Dallas and Dominic reach back to their neighborhood. Outside, nestled between their house, three news vans are parked haphazardly. 

Dominic parks the car and the two get out to see. 

PAT CLENDENEN, MID 50s, is outside their house in front of news cameras.

(to camera)
This afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. 
...and while we're all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. <!-- [ADDITION] Pat names brownouts — sets up Makayla's substation line in Scene 18 -->
We're also getting reports of rolling brownouts along the Route 146 corridor—UI says it's weather-related surges, but they're sending a crew to check the Branford substation.
<!-- [/ADDITION] -->
Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday's festival, but folks, get those generators ready!

Dominic scoffs as they walk past.

DOMINIC
Pat's been predicting the end of the world every Tuesday for ten years.

The wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.

EXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE 

They arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.

DOMINIC
Those raccoons! 

(action)
Dominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at the garbage cans around his house, then at Dallas.

Dallas notices that there are some weird burn marks on the ground. He gazes at them for a bit of time. <!-- [DELETION] Grid flicker — redundant with Pat's brownout report above; save visual proof for Scenes 10/11 -->
Above him, the streetlight at the end of the driveway cycles—on, off, on—in a slow, deliberate rhythm that doesn't match the others on the block.
<!-- [/DELETION] -->
Dominic continues to clean the mess from the garbage and Dallas continues to help not  paying attention to what Dominic is handing him, first a garbage bag, then a leaf bag, then up to - but helping none the less. 

DOMINIC
Listen, I got to get the furniture moved before the men's group tonight. I got to go check on Mike and bring in another AC from the basement. You good? 

DALLAS
(hesitates)
Yeah

DOMINIC
Do you want to stay for a bit?

DALLAS
Sure.
