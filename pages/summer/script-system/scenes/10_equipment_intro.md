INT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Makayla stops by Dallas's equipment. She doesn't look at it with Janice's annoyance; she looks with genuine curiosity.

MAKAYLA

This is military grade. What are you tracking?

DALLAS

Bioacoustics. Sounds in the marsh.

MAKAYLA

Does it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung.

Asher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.

DOMINIC

(yelling from the door)

Everyone in the car! We’re going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!

The family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.
