INT. DALLAS' NEW HOUSE - DAY

Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving boxes and a few pieces of furniture.

He hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers outside. Curious, he opens a box marked "EQUIPMENT."

Dallas pulls out a heavy, military-grade receiver. It's covered in dust. He peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.

The photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.

Dallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.

Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.

As he does this, he hears a HUM.

Dallas records readings, but the battery dies.

He sets the receiver down and heads for the door.
