EXT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - DAY

Dallas stares at the Tall Grass outside his house as he unloads boxes from a big pile. 

Dallas goes into the grass a little bit and as he does he notices that there is a makeshift trap - a small rig of a stick. Upon further examination he notices that it is not a trap but a recording device of sorts. 

As Dallas examines he hears a distinct bicycle ring.

MAKAYLA, 22 and ASHER, 14 - approach on bikes. They watch him for a while.

They approach Dallas slowly as one of the boxes draws their curiousity. Makayla watches Dallas pull out a military grade Oscillator.

MAKAYLA
(to Asher but loud enough for Dallas to hear)
You know that could be used to track the baseline difference between the cry of the BinzoBee and the howl of the Ophragah.


(action)
Asher nods. Makayla approaches Dallas. 

MAKAYLA
Hey mister. 

DALLAS
Yes?

MAKAYLA
Is that an Oscillator?

DALLAS
Yes. 

(action)
Makayla looks at Asher and whispers something in his ear. He nods. She returns glances to Dallas and inches her bike closer. 

MAKAYLA
Do you think my brother Asher could borrow it some time? 

(action)
Dallas looks at the Oscillator and then at Makayla and Asher

MAKAYLA
He needs it to gather evidence.

DALLAS
What kind of evidence? 

MAKAYLA
Tell him Asher. 

(action)
Asher stands silent in a sheepish shyness.

MAKAYLA
Does it work?

DALLAS
It does - but you need a power source. 

MAKAYLA
What if we connect audio cables to it - could we put some microphones in the tall grass and it'll reach it.

DALLAS
I suppose. 

MAKAYLA
What if I found a weird stone that pulses when storms approach - would it pick that up?

DALLAS
I'm not sure.

MAKAYLA
Well okay. Asher do you have any questions. 

(action)
Makayla turns to Asher. He shakes his head no. 

MAKAYLA
Okay then. Byeeeeeee.


(action)
Makayla and Asher peddle their bikes away. Dallas watches curiously and then peers at the swinging breeze of the tall grass.
