EXT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - DAY

Dallas stares at the Tall Grass outside his house as he loads boxes. He waves to DOMINIC and JANICE and the KIDS as they drive from the street. 

NT. DALLAS' NEW HOUSE - DAY

Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving boxes and a few pieces of furniture.

He hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers outside. Curious, he opens a box marked "EQUIPMENT."

Dallas pulls out a heavy, military-grade receiver. It's covered in dust. He peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.

The photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.

Dallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.

Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.

As he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside.

Dallas walks to the window and attempts to record the readings, and just as it capturing something, the battery dies.  

He sets the receiver down and heads for the door.
