EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NEXT DAY MORNING
Dallas walks outside and watches the tall grass sway in the wind. He looks at the grass for a beat too long, as he nurses the C battery in his hand. As he does so, he becomes in an almost daze As he walks he notices a man approaching him from the sidewalk near his house. 

DOMINIC, early 40s, wearing a bright salmon covered short sleeve button up approaches Dallas with great vigor. 

DOMINIC
Neighbor!

DALLAS
What's that?

DOMINIC
You are my neighbor - we saw you the other day driving by - did you just move here?

DALLAS
Oh - yeah.

DOMINIC
Nice. Names Dominic.

DALLAS
Dallas.

DOMINIC
Dallas, what a cool name - - What you up to?

DALLAS
I'm just walking into town - got to get some batteries.

DOMINIC
Oh yeah? Where abouts?

DALLAS
Not sure, I was just going to go to the hardware store. 

DOMINIC
So you're walking into town?

DALLAS
Yeah.

DOMINIC
You don't have a car?

DALLAS
No - no car.

DOMINIC
Yeah. Me neither - well I share one with my sister, she's borrowing mine. I was about to go  - there's a hardware store in Branford that could have those batteries. Would you like to tag along?

DALLAS
Sure.

EXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE

Dallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal sidewalks, neighborhoods, and natural marsh fences. As they approach one patch of tall marsh grass in particular, Dallas stops.

Dallas, sheepishly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he mumbles to himself. 

DOMINIC
Be careful - there are coyotes up in that. Some people say the noises are from owls - but I know its coyotes. 



EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

Dallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. 

INT. HARDWARE STORE
(action)
Dominic waves to the unfriendly man at the counter and brings Dallas to the battery section. 

DOMINIC
So where you from?

DALLAS
Indiana.

DOMINIC
INDIANAAAA - how'd you land up here in Branford?

(action)
Dallas finds the correct batteries and grabs it off the shelf. 

DALLAS
Work.

DOMINIC
Yeah? Where abouts? Yale?

DALLAS
Quinipiac. 

DOMINIC
That's refreshing... What are you doing with Quinipiac

DALLAS
Mostly field and bioacoustics. 


The building looks closed. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.

DOMINIC
You got to be kidding me!

(action)
He rips the ticket off and walks around to see if anyone is looking - and finds a secret key. 

As Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.

The streetlight above them flickers. Once. Twice. Then steadies. Dallas watches it for a beat, then looks back at the birds.

Dominic opens the car and gestures Dallas to get in - non-chantanly the parking ticket in the glove box. 

DOMINIC
You hungry?

DALLAS
(still in a daze)
Yeah

DOMINIC
Good -  my church is doing a fellowship lunch - little picnic - I got to go to the bakery and bring a tray. You should come. 

DALLAS
Sure. 

(action)

DOMINIC
Nice - yeah - it's nice to be the new guy in town - good old branford. 

EXT. MONTAGE WALK TO CHURCH

DOMINIC
So where you from?

DOMINIC

DALLAS

DOMINIC
Yeah? Where abouts

DOMINIC

DALLAS
No - maybe - but for now Quinnipiac.

DOMINIC
That's refreshing.
