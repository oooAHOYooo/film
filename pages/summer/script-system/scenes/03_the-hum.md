EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - DAY
Dallas walks outside and watches the tall grass sway in the wind. As he walks he notices a man approaching him from the sidewalk near his house. 

DOMINIC, early 40s, wearing a bright salmon covered short sleeve button up approaches Dallas with great vigor. 

DOMINIC
Neighbor!

DALLAS
What's that?

DOMINIC
You are my neighbor - we saw you the other day driving by - did you just move here?

DALLAS
Oh - yeah.

DOMINIC
Nice. Names Dominic.

DALLAS
Dallas.

DOMINIC
Dallas, what a cool name - - What you up to?

DALLAS
I'm just walking into town - got to get some batteries.

DOMINIC
What kind of batteries?

DALLAS
9 Volt should work.

DOMINIC
So you're walking into town?

DALLAS
Yeah.

DOMINIC
You don't have a car?

DALLAS
No - no car.

DOMINIC
Yeah. Me neither - well I share one with my sister, she's borrowing mine. I was about to go get it in town - there's a hardware store in Branford that could have those batteries. Want to walk together?

DALLAS
Sure.

EXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE

Dallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal scenes, and neighborhoods, and sidewalks. As they approach one in particular - a patch of tall marsh grass - Dallas stops.

Dallas, sheepishly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he pulls out a pocket recorder - and points it at the marsh.

DOMINIC
What's with the toy.

DALLAS
Oh, it's an audio recorder.

DOMINIC
Be careful - there are coyotes up in that.

Dallas continues to record.

DOMINIC
Come on champ. Hey - there's a fellowship lunch at my church today, CPC. You should come. Free food. We're going to be late though.

DALLAS
Sure.

EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

Dallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. The building looks closed. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.



DOMINIC
You have got to be kidding me!

(action)
He rips the ticket off, waving it at the empty street.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)
Twelve minutes! I was over twelve minutes. You see this, Dallas? This is where the taxes go. Not to fixing the potholes or the raccoon problem—oh no—it goes to the guy with the ticket book.

(action)
Dominic walks around and wiggles his hand above the car tire - finding a secret key here.

DOMINIC
This is not where it is supposed to go.


(action)
As Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.

DOMINIC
Hey you hungry?

DALLAS
Yeah

DOMINIC
Good - my church is doing a fellowship lunch - little picnic - we'll go first and fuel up before getting the car. Don't worry Pal - we'll get your batteries together. 

INT. CAR - DRIVING TO CPC

Dominic drives from Branford Town Center toward the church. Dallas in the passenger seat.

DOMINIC
So where you from?

DALLAS
Indiana

DOMINIC
Indiana - how'd you land up here in Branford? 

DALLAS
Work

DOMINIC
Yeah? Where abouts

DOMINIC
Yale?

DALLAS
No - maybe - but for now Quinnipiac.

DOMINIC
That's refreshing.

(action)
They pull into the church lot. The fellowship lawn is ahead—picnic in full swing.
