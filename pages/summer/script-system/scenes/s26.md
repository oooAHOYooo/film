EXT. SALT MARSH - DAY (CONTINUOUS)

The younger creatures—two or three—scatter. The elders lift their hands. From their backs, a fine mist sprays out.

Dallas and Makayla stiffen. Their bodies are no longer their own. The hum rolls over them. They are walking backward, away from the circle, step by step. Howie whines, pulled with them.

More lights appear. Dozens of golden glows rise like lanterns in the mist. Then the red eyes. They multiply at the edge of the reeds, contrasting with the gold.

The red eyes begin to circle the golden ones. One by one, in a blur—the mind fills in a predator pouncing—they snatch the lights. The red-eye creatures don't hum. They cancel. Sound disappears the way shadow erases light.

<!-- [ADDITION] Makayla witnesses extinction in real time — motivates her trap design -->
MAKAYLA
(whispering, barely audible)
They're erasing the frequency. If there's nothing left to record, no one will ever know they existed.
<!-- [/ADDITION] -->

More predators emerge. For every inch they creep, shadow climbs the tall grass. The paralysis holding Dallas and Makayla seems to come from the elders—a last effort to protect the humans—but the elders are no match. The red eyes blink. The small creatures huddle in terror.

Dallas and Makayla move slowly at first, then break into a brisk walk back the way they came. Dallas glances back.

The dark shadow creatures engulf Dallas and Makayla in a chaos of light and fury - while this happens their shadow tentacles hit 

In the distance: the tiny creature. Its pulse blinks large once—then dims. An awful sound of gnashing. Something has it.

Dallas stops. He pulls out the dial. He turns it. The creature's pulse flares again. The predators retract. In that split second, Dallas runs forward, grabs the creature, and runs.

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

Dallas runs with the creature in his coat. He stops. Looks down. The creature has stopped pulsing. It is motionless. He sets it down. Other golden pulses gather around it. The hum drops—lower and lower on the bass scale.

Dallas backs away. Makayla and Howie are already at the edge of the grass. He catches up. They don't look back. They make their way out of the tall grass.

EXT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATE DAY (STORM)

The sun sets. The crew peer out at the yard and the tall grass.

DOMINIC
Let's have some dinner.

He wipes the counter hard. A cup tips over. Mr. Mike nods from his chair.

MR. MIKE
Good time to eat.

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Dominic and Asher cook. Makayla and Dallas share a glance at the window—Dallas watching the weather, <!-- [ADDITION] -->the equipment in the yard,<!-- [/ADDITION] --> the grass.

They eat standing, plates in hand, taking turns at the window. Outside, the noise grows. Sniffs. Gnarls. The creatures. Makayla rattles in her chair, impatient.

MAKAYLA
What should we do?

Dominic looks defeated. Dallas says nothing. Mr. Mike rocks in his chair, muttering. He taps the same three beats on the armrest, over and over.

MR. MIKE
One-one-five point three. One-one-five point three.

Dominic is hesitant. He asks Dallas for answers about the field. Dallas doesn't have them. Dominic argues they should focus on boarding up the house for the storm.

As he speaks—Makayla bolts. She runs out the back door, cutting across the yard toward the reeds before anyone can grab her.

The sound spikes once. Sharper. Shorter. Then it cuts.

Makayla snatches the crystal from her pocket and sprints. Dominic chases her. He can't reach her in time. He hesitates at the edge of the tall grass. He cries her name. Asher and Dallas reach the grass and stare.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas powers on the speakers and the oscillator. The trap hums to life—a low, steady broadcast aimed at the corridor between the equipment.

Howie cowers next to him. Mr. Mike watches from the window. Dominic rushes past for flashlights. He tries to call Makayla on the two-way radio—Asher has the other walkie. 

Dallas waits with Howie on the porch. He watches his equipment. The blinking orange light turns green. He hurries over to inspect. The indicator: green, then orange pulses.

The storm approaches. The two of them pace. Mr. Mike, inside, hears the thunder and yells.

MR. MIKE
They're coming! They're coming!

Dallas checks the trap one last time—the speakers are holding, the sensor blinking steady between them.

A distant cry. Then the low hum. Night falls. The winds pick up. Eyes circulate in the fields. Dominic grabs Dallas's sleeve. Dallas pulls free without turning around.

Dallas brings Howie inside. He sets the leash on the hook like he'll be back in a minute. He rubs Howie's face. Leaves the porch light on. Then he heads out to the tall grass.

EXT. TALL GRASS - NIGHT

A strange silence engulfs Dallas despite the wind. He sees a glimmer of fading light and moves toward it. The sensation of being watched almost overwhelms him. He keeps going.

He stops. Pulls a crumpled napkin from his pocket. Opens it: 45 L 15 R. It matches his equipment. The compass on the device.

In the distance: Makayla, holding one of the creatures. Asher and Dominic sit next to her, dazed. But Makayla isn't crying out. She isn't frozen. She is focused.

In her lap: Dallas's oscillator. She has it wired to the creature's back-holes with the alligator clips from the kitchen triage. Her fingers move across the dial with precision—adjusting, listening, adjusting again. The creature's golden pulse flickers in time with her tuning.

She is actively broadcasting—matching the creature's output frequency and amplifying it outward. The golden light around them strengthens. The dark shapes at the edge of the reeds hesitate.

Dallas stops. He watches her. This isn't the girl who asked "What does that do?" in the kitchen. She has mastered the tool he gave her.

Little by little, dark eyes appear around them. Another creature of the same size emerges and begins to nurture the one Makayla holds.

Dallas kneels beside her. He makes contact with the creature through his receiver. The creature begins to sing—and the oscillator catches the song, amplifies it, pushes it outward in a wave that rolls across the marsh.

The creature looks at Makayla and other creatures around it step forward. It reaches a small limb and touches the Crystal in her hand. Makayla gives it to her. The Crystal changes color - it stops glowing and settles into a rich amber solid. 

Another creature chimes and the family reunites. 

Makayla looks down at the stone - no longer a crystal but 

The crew are paralyzed—and so are the dark forces. The Red-Eyes don't just cower. They lock in place—stun-locked, the same phase cancellation Makayla designed at the gap. Total silence around the predators. Total stillness.

Makayla glances down at the oscillator screen. The waveform is clean. Sharp. Unmistakable. She hits record.

The storm rages. The creatures retreat into their holes in the gnarls of the soft trees. The Red-Eyes unfreeze and scatter into the dark.

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT / DAWN

Dallas, Dominic, and Makayla sit by the window and watch for the night to end. It does.

EXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - MORNING

Morning. Dallas is still making calculations. Then he stops. <!-- [DELETION] REVIEW: giving up contradicts the legacy additions -->He puts his equipment in the trash.<!-- [/DELETION] --> The crew leaves. Dallas is alone again.

He looks outside. The soft sound—the pulse of the creature—returns. Faint. There. He listens.
