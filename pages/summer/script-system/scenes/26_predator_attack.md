INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - DAY

MR. MIKE barges through the front door. MAKAYLA chases after him.

MR. MIKE
Where is it? Where is it?

He searches the kitchen, the hall, haphazard. Makayla makes desperate eye contact with DALLAS, who is by the window with his equipment.

EXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

JANICE gets out of her car and stops. Strange burn marks run along the minivan's panels. She pulls out her phone, takes a photo, then scrapes one mark with her key.

ASHER, beside her, follows the trail with his eyes. Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows.

ASHER
Mom. Look.

(action)
Janice can't find Dallas. Inside, he's in the backyard, staring at the marsh with his oscillator. The readings are erratic—spikes he hasn't seen before. He scans the tree line. Something has changed.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Makayla watches from a distance. She walks over. She doesn't ask permission. She picks up the second receiver and starts scanning frequencies alongside him. Dallas's reading on the handheld jumps. He looks over. A beat. He acknowledges her.

They work in silence—listening, adjusting, mapping the signal. Makayla pulls out Sierra's folder and cross-references a frequency notation with what's on screen. A match.

MAKAYLA
What happened?

Dallas doesn't answer. Makayla reads his face.

MAKAYLA
The creature?

(action)
Dallas nods. Makayla grabs his device off the table. DOMINIC appears and grabs her wrist. The three of them stand there. From the direction of the marsh—a cry. Distant, unmistakable. The creature. Then the hum, low and everywhere.

Dominic grabs Makayla's arm, pulling her toward the house.

DOMINIC
We need to get inside. Now.

Makayla pulls free. She turns to both of them. Her eyes dart in the direction of the tall grass on the edge of Dallas' yard. 

MAKAYLA
If that creature's frequency hits the transformer on the street while it's being attacked, the feedback loop will fry the whole grid. We aren't just rescuing a pet, Dominic. We're keeping the lights on for the whole neighborhood.

A beat. Dominic stares at her. Dallas stares at her.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
We have to go get it back.

Dallas looks at the tall grass. At the reading. At her. Then toward the house—Howie. They grab him and start down the trail.

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

Dallas, Makayla, and Howie push through the reeds. The same glow they saw before—flickering, faint. They rush toward it. The trail leads toward the salt marsh. As they inch closer, they see them: a group of creatures, birdlike and small, gathered in a loose circle. They are attending to the injured one—the one from the shoebox. Gentle, urgent.

Dallas and Makayla slow. Howie whines. The creatures have not yet scattered. For a moment, it looks like help. Like a family.
