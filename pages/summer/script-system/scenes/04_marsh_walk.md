EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

The sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.

Dominic and Dallas walk quietly for a while. Dominic looks out to the tall grass.

DOMINIC
The kids are always out here with their cameras.

(action)

Dominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.

DOMINIC

See this? Merlins. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.

(action)

Dallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.

Dominc
What the heck is that?

DALLAS
It's a portable Oscillator. It tells me what kind of low frequencies are in the air - to see if it is worth recording. 



DOMINIC

Suit yourself. But lately - i've heard rumors that there's a spot near the old creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.

(action)
Dallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.
