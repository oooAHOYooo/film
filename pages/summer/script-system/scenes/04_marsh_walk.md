EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

The sun is dipping. Dallas and Dominic walk along a wooden boardwalk that cuts through the tall, golden-yellow reeds.

Dominic pulls out his phone, tapping an app.

DOMINIC

See this? Listen - those are *seagulls. It listens to the chirps and tells you the species. Coastal stuff mostly—Egret, Plover. You should get it if you're working at Quinnipiac.

(action)
Dallas pulls out his own military-grade receiver. He adjusts a dial. Through his heavy headsets, he doesn't hear birds. He hears a low, rhythmic THRUB-THRUB-THRUB.

DOMINIC
Your little toy showing you good results?
There’s a spot near the edge of the entrance creek where the Coyotes gather. Sounds like a choir of demons at 2 AM. You'll hear 'em soon enough.

(action)
Dallas stops. He looks into the thick grass. The wind moves the reeds, but it looks like something else is moving *underneath* them, contrary to the breeze.
