INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.

Shadows—tall, spindly, and darker than the night—grow in the distance. They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships.

He touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long.

The hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames. <!-- [ADDITION] Interior light drain — the creature is pulling current from the house -->
The overhead light dims—not a flicker, but a slow, steady drain, as if something is pulling the current out of the walls. Then it returns to full brightness.
<!-- [/ADDITION] -->

A doorbell is heard off screen breaking Dallas out of his trance.

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dallas opens the door to find Asher and Dominic.

DOMINIC

DALLAS

(action)
Asher looks behind Dallas at all of the equipment. Dallas hands Howie over to Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Okay - we'll - we'll be on our way. Hey - are you still okay with hosting lifegroup on Thursday

Dallas
Yeah. 

DOMINIC
Okay... Hey - everything okay?

DALLAS
Yeah - sorry - I'm just a little tired. 

DOMINIC
Alright well rest well big guy. 

(action)
Asher and Dominic and Howie leave and walk into the next side door. Dallas watches them - and then watches the tall grass sway in the wind. 

Dallas rushes to the kitchen and finds that the creature is doing good.
