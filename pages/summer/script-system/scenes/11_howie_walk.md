EXT. BRANFORD ROCKS - EVENING

The Long Island Sound roars, the waves crashing violently against the Branford rocks. Dallas walks Howie along the perimeter of his new property.

Dallas holds his portable reader out. The needle isn't just moving; it's spiking. The closer they get to the tall grass, the more violent the readings become.

DALLAS

(to himself)

What are you?

Howie stops. His ears perk up, swiveling like small radar dishes toward the dark reeds.

In the far distance, a single dog barks. Then another. A chain reaction of domestic fear starts in the neighborhood, followed by the high, thin yip of coyotes further inland.

Dallas pulls out his phone. A "Severe Weather Alert" pops up: STORM WARNING.
