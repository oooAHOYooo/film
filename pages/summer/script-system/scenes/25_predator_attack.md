INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - DAY

MR. MIKE barges through the front door. MAKAYLA chases after him.

MR. MIKE
Where is it? Where is it?

He searches the kitchen, the hall, haphazard. Makayla makes desperate eye contact with DALLAS, who is by the window with his equipment.

EXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

JANICE gets out of her car and stops. Strange burn marks run along the minivan's panels. She pulls out her phone, takes a photo, then scrapes one mark with her key.

ASHER, beside her, follows the trail with his eyes. Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows.

ASHER
Mom. Look.

Janice can't find Dallas. Inside, he's in the backyard, staring at the marsh with his oscillator. He moves a pole slightly and checks the read again.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Makayla watches from a distance. She walks over, picks up another pole, and plants it. She adjusts a wire. Dallas's reading on the handheld jumps. He looks over. A beat. He acknowledges her.

They work in silence—digging, planting poles, stringing wire. A makeshift fence taking shape around the edge of the property.

MAKAYLA
What happened?

Dallas doesn't answer. Makayla reads his face.

MAKAYLA
The creature?

Dallas nods. Makayla grabs his device off the table. DOMINIC appears and grabs her wrist. The three of them stand there. From the direction of the marsh—a cry. Distant, unmistakable. The creature. Then the hum, low and everywhere.

Makayla turns to Dallas.

MAKAYLA
We have to go get it back. The bad creatures want to kill it.

Dallas looks at the tall grass. At the reading. At her. Then toward the house—Howie. They grab him and start down the trail.

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

Dallas, Makayla, and Howie push through the reeds. The same glow they saw before—flickering, faint. They rush toward it. The trail leads toward the salt marsh. As they inch closer, they see them: a group of creatures, birdlike and small, gathered in a loose circle. They are attending to the injured one—the one from the shoebox. Gentle, urgent.

Dallas and Makayla slow. Howie whines. The creatures have not yet scattered. For a moment, it looks like help. Like a family.
