INT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas struggles to fall asleep in his new home. He hears strange noises from outside. As he looks out the window he sees a flicker of a faint gold light. 

Curious and wide awake - Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving supplies and a few pieces of furniture.

He hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers through his living room window. 

Dallas looks back at a pile of unopened boxes in the middle of his living room. He hestitates but makes his way towards a box marked "Lepidoptera by Sierra".

Dallas opens up the box to find sketches of buttleries - and other insects. 


Dallas pulls out a heavy, a bunch of old vanilla folders, another military-grade desktop Oscillator, a portable audio recorder, an a portable Oscillator. 

One of the folders slips open as he lifts it—inside, a glimpse of hand-drawn sketches and a tab labeled "FIELD NOTES — BRANFORD 2004." Dallas closes it without looking and sets the stack aside.

In the bottom of the box, covered in dust, sumberged by cables,  Dallas finds and old pair of retro red headphones.

On one of the headphones, Dallas peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.

The photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.

Dallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.

Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.

As he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside. The sound is faint and he listens

Dallas walks to the window and attempts to record the readings, and just as it capturing something, the battery dies. 


Scrambling, Dallas looks through his box of equipment for other devices but they all take C batteries. 

Dallas, fustrated, throws down the equipment and heads for the door. 

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas stands alone watching the tall grass sway agaisnt the salt breeze. The hum seems to be decreasing in scale and size as the night disappears into the distance of the tall marsh grass.

INT. DALLAS HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

Dallas struggles to go to sleep. As he hears more faint cries he looks out the window and sees a faint golden glow again.
