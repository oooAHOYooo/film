INT. DALLAS MUDROOM - NIGHT (DURING LIFEGROUP)

The sound of the LifeGroup singing "Great Is Thy Faithfulness" is muffled by the heavy basement door. 

MAKAYLA, DALLAS, and ASHER are crouched in the mudroom, shoulder-to-shoulder. Dallas is strapping the Oscillator rig over his jacket. The Crystal is locked in the center, humming with the frequency of a low-voltage wire.

Makayla taps the screen on her portable viewfinder. It’s a mess of jagged red lines.

The Shadows are spiking at the Creek Bend. We have ten minutes before the Crystal hits the inversion limit. If it burns out out there, we're blind.

Dallas tightens the straps on the Oscillator rig over his jacket. The Crystal is locked in the center, humming with the frequency of a low-voltage wire.

Asher looks at his notebook and says 115.3.

(action)
Makayla clicks a "Master" switch on the device. A small, protective green light flickers on.
