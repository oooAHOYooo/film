EXT. MARSH TRAIL - DAY

Dallas walks the coastal trail with Howie. Suddenly, the air vibrates. A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds.

Howie whines, pressing against Dallas’s leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.

His handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it’s a repeating, melodic pattern.

DALLAS

(to Howie)

Stay here.

He ties Howie’s leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.
