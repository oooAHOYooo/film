# Scene 24: The Burn Marks
<!-- summary:  -->

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - MORNING

Dominic into his basement and looks at all of the gear that was previously on the creature. 

EXT. DALLAS BACKYARD

Dallas looks goes to look at the tall grass for a while. 

Out of breath Makayla and Asher come riding with their bicycles.

MAKAYLA
How is the burn mark developed?

(action)
Makayla sizes up Dallas and reaches for his arm. She holds it - and realizes that the same burn marks that are on the ground - are also on Dallas' arm - and her arm as well. 

MAKAYLA
This isn't good. 

(action)
Dallas looks at the ground for a long time at the burn mark. It seems to have increased in size and now is forming lines of darkness towards his house, not unlike a corrupt vein system. 

Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows. Makayla follows them. She does some quiet mental math and takes a deep breath.

Dallas looks at all of his gear scattered across the lawn and the picnic table. 

MAKAYLA
Does one of your devices could it be reversed engineered to transmit the sound that you have been recording.

(action)
Makayla doesn't answer. She grabs one of the portable speakers and positions it on the picnic table. 

DALLAS
I suppose. 

(action)
A faint hum is heard off in the distance.  Makayla turns to the group. 

Makayla hits the trigger. A sound like a glass crackles under pressure ripples out. 

The grass at the edge of the yard sways rhythimically. Freezing in place. 

Dallas notices that the "vein" burn mark - turns from a dark brown to a dull brown to a light brown - to a dark green. 

MAKAYLA
We have to go back... We will wait for the evening and then strike.... Asher - we need to get the oscillator rigged up - the device is at the lair. 

(action)
Asher nods and runs off toward his house.

MAKAYLA
But the batteries won't hold for more than a few minutes.

(action)
Makayla looks and sizes up Dallas.

MAKAYLA
Dallas, you should come too. 

EXT. MAKAYLA'S LAIR - LATE SUN

Makayla and Asher and Dallas sit on a tree log among the Long Island Sound. They watch - as the wind picks up - and the storms clouds make their way. 

MAKAYLA
I really think the storm will pass... It's been 17 years since our mom has passed and we've been living with Dominic and Aunt Janice. 

(action)
Dallas looks onward

Asher brings the final device forward. He checks his notebook once—1153—then hands it to Makayla.
