INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - DAY (NEXT MORNING OR LATER)

Dominic into his basement and looks at all of the gear that was previously on the creature. 

EXT. DALLAS BACKYARD

Dallas looks goes to look at the tall grass for a while. 

Out of breath Makayla and Asher come riding with their bicycles.

MAKAYLA
We got to go now - 

Dallas looks at the ground for a long time at the burn mark. It seems to have increased in size and now is going towards a path in the house. 

Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows.

MAKAYLA
Asher look at this. A path. Something left. Something came for the creature... DALLAS we have to go back. 

DALLAS

MAKAYLA

Dallas thinks for a moment but his face says it all.

DALLAS
