INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - MORNING

Dominic into his basement and looks at all of the gear that was previously on the creature. 

EXT. DALLAS BACKYARD

Dallas looks goes to look at the tall grass for a while. 

Out of breath Makayla and Asher come riding with their bicycles.

MAKAYLA
How is the burn mark developed?

(action)
Makayla sizes up Dallas and reaches for his arm. She holds it - and realizes that the same burn marks that are on the ground - are also on Dallas' arm - and her arm as well. 

MAKAYLA
This isn't good. 

(action)
Dallas looks at the ground for a long time at the burn mark. It seems to have increased in size and now is forming lines of darkness towards his house, not unlike a corrupt vein system. 

Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows. Makayla follows them. She does some quiet mental math and takes a deep breath.

MAKAYLA
Does one of your devices could it be reversed engineered to transmit the sound that you have been recording.

(action)
Dallas thinks for a moment but his face says it all.

DALLAS
I suppose. 

(action)
A faint hum is heard off in the distance.  Makayla turns to the group. 

MAKAYLA
We have to go back - and pause the dark creatures - to allow for the light creatures space to leave this place.  We will wait for the evening and then strike. 

ASHER
Asher lets go back to the spot and see if we need anything.

(action)
Makayla looks and sizes up Dallas.

MAKAYLA
Dallas, you come too. 

EXT. MAKAYLA'S FORT - LATE SUN

Makayla and Asher and Dallas sit on a tree log among the Long Island Sound. They watch - as the wind picks up - and the storms clouds make their way. 

MAKAYLA
I really think the storm will pass... It's been 17 years since our mom has passed and we've been living with Dominic and Aunt Janice. 

(action)
Dallas looks onward

Asher brings the final device forward.
