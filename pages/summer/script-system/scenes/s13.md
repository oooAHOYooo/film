EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - DAWN

The morning air is thick with the scent of ozone. Janice's minivan idles in the driveway. She drops Howie off, barely waving as she rushes toward the museum to secure artwork before the storm hits.

Makayla and Asher don't follow her. They wander toward the edge of Dallas's property.

MAKAYLA
Asher, look.

In the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.

Makayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.

Makayla - from the corner of her eye - and sees the creature. In a flurry she runs inside Dallas house. 


EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC
Life group tonight. Thanks for hosting. I'm heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries?

DALLAS
I'm good.

DOMINIC
Listen, Makayla and Asher - help Dallas okay - I'll be back in 45 minutes. You know what to do - we got to get this place looking ready. Chairs inside - count how many.

MAKAYLA
You got it Uncle Dominic. 

(action)
Dominic peels out. Dallas watches him drive away. then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.

MAKAYLA
Great - okay Dallas - where is it. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN

Makayla stand dumbfounded looking at the creature - they can't believe it. They walk around Makayla stares at it for a good while. As if she is finally vindicated - and that her name will go down in all of history for finally discovering the creature of Branford.

<!-- [ADDITION] Makayla documents like a scientist — establishes her legacy motivation -->
She pulls out her phone and starts recording video. Then stops. She puts the phone away and instead grabs a notebook from her back pocket—the same one she jots coordinates in. She begins to sketch the creature. Careful, precise lines. The back-holes. The ears. The glow. She is documenting it the way a scientist would, not the way a teenager would.
