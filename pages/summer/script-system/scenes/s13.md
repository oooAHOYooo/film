EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC
This is the music for life group tonight. Thanks for hosting. I'm heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries? That storm has gotten me all rattled. 

DALLAS
I'm good.

DOMINIC
Listen, Makayla and Asher - help Dallas okay - I'll be back in 45. You know what to do - we got to get this place looking sharp. Chairs inside - brownies in oven - we're going to have a good amount of folks tonight. 

MAKAYLA
You got it Uncle Dominic. 

(action)
Dominic peels out. Dallas watches him drive away. then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.

MAKAYLA
Great - okay Dallas - where is it. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN

Makayla stand dumbfounded looking at the creature - they can't believe it. They walk around Makayla stares at it for a good while. As if she is finally vindicated - and that her name will go down in all of history for finally discovering the creature of Branford.

<!-- [ADDITION] Makayla documents like a scientist — establishes her legacy motivation -->
She pulls out her phone and starts recording video. Then stops. She puts the phone away and instead grabs a notebook from her back pocket—the same one she jots coordinates in. She begins to sketch the creature. Careful, precise lines. The back-holes. The ears. The glow. She is documenting it the way a scientist would, not the way a teenager would.
