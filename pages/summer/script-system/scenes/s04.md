EXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in heat of a picnic. Children are running, friends down light summerwear as they play spike ball, and church goers find themselvees are on a long line getting food. Dallas looks around at all of the new faces but does not make great eye contact. Dominic takes a deep breath and approaches the long line. 

Dominic carries a package of water and puts it under one of the fold up tables. As he does so, people look at Dallas and begin to greet him. 

DOMINIC
Alright buddy - let's wait on line I guess. 

(action)
Dominic and Dallas wait on line to be served at fellowship lunch. As they do people begin to turn around and talk to them. One lady, MARY, 55 turns around and shakes Dallas' hand enthustiaclly.

MARY

DALLAS

Another turns around and greets Dallas. An older gentleman PAUL WILDLY, 72, 

PAUL

Dallas and Dominic sit in a circle of folded pull up chairs. 

JANICE AMARANTO, Mid 50s, taps Dominic's shoulder.

DOMINIC
Sister.

JANICE
Brother. 

DOMINIC
(ignoring Janice)
Dallas, these are my niece and nephew - Makayla and Asher.

(action)
Makayla and Asher don't say much but wait online. Makayla taps Asher on the shoulder and nods towards a far end of the church lawn. Between the bushes and garden. 

The two leave the line walk over to a corner spot by the end of the church yard and huddle over a pile of brush.

JANICE
So what happened Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Yeah - and it had a ticket.

JANICE
How much. 

DOMINIC
A good amount. 

JANICE
That's great. 

Janice leaves the line of food.

Dallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted by what Makayla and Asher are looking at the distance. 

Janice, noticing that Dallas is a little quiet - tries to spark conversation. 

DOMINIC
So, what are you here for?

DALLAS
Work.

DOMINIC

DALLAS

DOMINIC
What kind of work?

DALLAS

DOMINIC
Nice. So are you here alone?

DALLAS
Yep.

DOMINIC
Okay cool. That's cool.

(action)
They finish eating. The group begins to disperse. Janice walks over to Dallas and hands him Howie again.
