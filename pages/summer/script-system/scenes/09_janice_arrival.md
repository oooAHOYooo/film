INT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

The front door slams open. JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. Behind her, ASHER (15) and MAKAYLA (22) trudge in, staring at their phones.

JANICE

(spitting out keys)

The traffic on I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why are you cooking the sprouts already? They’ll be mush by the time the group gets here.

DOMINIC

I’m following the recipe, Janice.

JANICE

(inspecting the pot)

You’re boiling them? You’re supposed to roast them! And the gravy—is that a lump?

Janice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas’s heavy receiver on the floor.

JANICE (CONT'D)

What is this? A boat anchor?

DALLAS

It’s a receiver. For work.

Dominic ushers everyone toward the car for a quick errand. The kitchen is a whirlwind of coats, overlapping arguments, and the smell of scorched sprouts.
