EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

Dallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.

DOMINIC
You have got to be kidding me!

(action)
He rips the ticket off, waving it at the empty street.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)
Twelve minutes! I was over twelve minutes. You see this, Dallas? This is where the taxes go. Not to fixing the potholes or the raccoon problem—oh no—it goes to the guy with the ticket book.

(action)
Dominic walks around and wiggles his hand above the car tire - finding a secret key here. 

DOMINIC
This is not where it is supposed to go. 


(action)
As Dominic struggles to look for the key, Dallas' glance finds himself looking up at the power lines with the birds acting weird. looking up. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.

INT. CAR RIDE
Dominic drives back from Branford Town Center and drives Dallas back.

DOMINIC
So where you from?

DALLAS

DOMINIC
