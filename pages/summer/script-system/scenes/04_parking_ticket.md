EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

Dallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.

DOMINIC

You have got to be kidding me!

He rips the ticket off, waving it at the empty street.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)

Twelve minutes! I was over twelve minutes. You see this, Dallas? This is where the taxes go. Not to fixing the potholes or the raccoon problem—oh no—it goes to the guy with the ticket book.

DALLAS

Raccoon problem?

DOMINIC

They’re everywhere. Knocking over bins, tearing up siding. Bold, too. They don’t even run anymore.

Dallas isn’t looking at the ticket. He’s looking up. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.

DALLAS

Dominic. Look at the birds.

Dominic glances up, then back at his ticket, uncaring.

DOMINIC

Probably waiting for a hand-out. Come on, let’s get your batteries before I get another fine for standing still.
