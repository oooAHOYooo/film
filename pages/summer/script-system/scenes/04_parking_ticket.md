EXT. TOWN CENTER - DAY

Dallas and Dominic walk toward a small hardware store. Dominic stops dead. A neon orange ticket flutters under his windshield wiper.

DOMINIC
You have got to be kidding me!

(action)
He rips the ticket off, waving it at the empty street.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)
Twelve minutes! I was over twelve minutes. You see this, Dallas? This is where the taxes go. Not to fixing the potholes or the raccoon problem—oh no—it goes to the guy with the ticket book.

(action)
Dominic walks around and opens the door for Dallas but the lock is not quite working. 

DOMINIC
I'm just going to leave 

They’re everywhere. Knocking over bins, tearing up siding. Bold, too. They don’t even run anymore.

(action)
Dallas isn’t looking at the ticket. He’s looking up. On a sagging power line, thirty birds sit in a perfect, silent row. They aren't preening or chirping. Every single beak is pointed South-East. Toward the marsh.

INT. CAR RIDE
Dominic drives back from Branford Town Center and drives Dallas back.

DOMINIC
So where you from?

DALLAS
Indiana. 

DOMINIC
What you doing up here?

DALLAS
Work

DOMINIC
Yeah? Where abouts

DOMINIC
Yale?

DALLAS
Quinipacc

DOMINIC
That's refreshing.
