INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - EVENING (CONTINUOUS)

Dominic is flabbergasted. He sits. The crew huddle around the kitchen table. No one speaks. Dominic gets up and locks the front door without looking at it.

Dallas lays tiny wires on the creature's head, connecting them to his handheld. When the creature is calm, it emits a low, melodic tone through the holes in its back. HOWIE barks from the corner. The creature's holes shift—the sound becomes a sad cry, like a whimper.

Dominic can't take the quiet. He starts to argue.

DOMINIC
Could be some kind of bird. From the ground. Something that nests in the marsh.

MR. MIKE
You're all wrong.

MAKAYLA
We should put it back where we found it. We can't have it in the house.

MR. MIKE
We need to leave now. They're coming for it. It's not safe here.

Dominic stands. The crew scramble—they have to move the creature before anyone else arrives. They head for the basement.

The doorbell chimes.

INT. DALLAS'S HALL - MOMENTS LATER

The first family for the life group: a young couple—JOSH and SARAH—with their newborn, JP. They introduce themselves to Dallas. He acts off. Distant. Dominic paces in the kitchen. Mr. Mike mutters in his chair, staring at the weather through the window. It's getting worse.

MR. MIKE
(to himself)
This is all a farce. They should be out there. Return it.

Josh and Sarah know to ignore him. They smile, make small talk. Mr. Mike keeps muttering, almost in frustration.

MR. MIKE
One-one-five point two. Hertz. Hertz.

Dallas glances at the basement door. Downstairs, the creature is hidden. For now.
