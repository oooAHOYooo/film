# Scene 14: The Vision
<!-- summary: They sit with the creature. Evidence. A bond. Howie at their feet. -->

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN

Dallas watches Makayla from far away as she and Asher look at the creature from afar. 

EXT. DALLAS BACKYARD - OLD PICNIC TABLE 

Makayla and Dallas look on the ground for a while as they sit outside the patio. Howie sleeps peacefully near Dallas' feet nearby.

Asher sits alone a few feet away—drawing in his notebook. Not the creature; repeating shapes, like the burn mark pattern.

MAKAYLA
So your wife was an Epistemologist?

DALLAS
How did you know that?

MAKAYLA
I saw a folder open. Where is she now?

DALLAS
She's gone.

MAKAYLA
Ah... our mom too. 

(action)
Asher looks at the distance, then the ground, then the tall grass. His finger traces something on his leg—the same pattern, over and over. 

DALLAS
Is Asher okay?

MAKAYLA
He's fine... He's just processing. 

DALLAS
And how are you doing?

MAKAYLA
I'm fine.

DALLAS
What did you see?



***

MAKAYLA
What do you think it is?

DALLAS
I am not sure.

MAKAYLA
I don't think its an alien.

DALLAS
No, I don't think so either.

MAKAYLA
What do you know about sound?

DALLAS
I know that certain frequencies don't record - they repel. 

MAKAYLA
And the frequiences that that creature is making.

DALLAS
It seems to be recording.

MAKAYLA
Recording what? 

DALLAS
Well, everything records in a way. 

MAKAYLA
And what repels.

DALLAS
I am not sure.

MAKAYLA
So what are we talking about?

(action)
Dallas and Makayla sit for a while on the long old picnic table outside his house. 

MAKAYLA
We need to document this... Dallas. 

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - LATER

Makayla and Dallas walk into the kitchen and find the creature sleeping peacefully below the heat lamp. 

MAKAYLA
I've read about fish the way the transmit information. Scientists forever thought that the sea was silent - but our ears just can't pick up the right frequenies.

(action)
Makayla turns and begins to sketch. 

Dallas has turned his kitchen island into a triage station. He’s wired a portable oscilloscope to the creature’s head using tiny alligator clips.

Makayla begins to sketch the creature. Careful, precise lines. The back-holes. The ears. The glow. She is documenting it the way a scientist would, not the way a teenager would.


The device pulses in a rhythmic, golden jagged line —perfectly in sync with the creature's heartbeat.

In the distance they hear howls - and then silence again. 

The creature begins to fade - Dallas turns the dial into another frequency range and waits until it is asleep. 

Makayla 
(to Dallas)
What does that do?

Dallas
(whispering)
It changes the frequency I am transmitting.

Makayla
And you think that it somehow is like talking to the creature?

Dallas
Yes. 

Asher comes in and gathers around the creature too—notebook in one hand, pencil still. He doesn't draw it. Just watches. His finger traces a small pattern on the edge of the island. 

Dallas adjusts the dial on his military receiver to a 115.3 MHz frequency. The creature's breathing stabilizes. It lets out a low, melodic tone through its back-holes.

Makayla leans over the oscilloscope. She points at the screen. 

Makayla looks at Dallas and then at the creature and pulls out a small prototype from her backpack. 

MAKAYLA
The small device should wake up the creature. 

(action)
Makayla turns away from Dallas sight and places the crystal she has found inside a palceholder for where a battery would go on a circut board.

She turns to the creature and turns it on. 

The creature starts to wiggle.

MAKAYLA
Wait. Look at that.

Behind the creature's smooth sine wave, a second signal appears—jagged, arrhythmic. It pulses in sharp, irregular bursts, riding underneath the creature's frequency like static beneath music.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
That's not coming from the creature. That's a draw. It's pulling power.

She looks at Dallas. In the distance a hum emerges

Dallas stares at the secondary wave on the screen. 

Howie sits in the corner, head cocked, shivering. Outside, the world responds: the windows rattle, and a deep, distant hum echoes from the town center.

Makayla goes back inside and huddles around the creature. Makayla presses her crystal next to the creature's neck and has a vision.

Makayla's eyes begin to roll back and she has a vision.

EXT. MAKAYLA'S VISION - MONTAGE

EXT. MARSH - DAY (VISION)

Silence. 

A figure stands in the tall grass. A woman - older, etheral but with Makayla's eyes. She turns and her face is obscured by the sun. She looks down at the creature with sadness and then touches Makayla's forehead.

VOICE (V.O)
Light doesn't leave. It changes.

The woman fades in the sky.

INT. KITCHEN - DAY (Reality)

Makayla gasps, slamming back into her body. 

The doorbell rings.
