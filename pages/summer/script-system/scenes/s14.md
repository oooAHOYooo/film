<!-- nickname: DALLAS AND MAKYLA BOND -->

EXT. DALLAS OUTSIDE PATIO

Makayla and Dallas look on the ground for a while as they sit outside the patio. Howie sleeps peacefully near Dallas' feet nearby.

MAKAYLA
What do you think it is?

DALLAS
I am not sure.

MAKAYLA
I don't think its an alien.

DALLAS
No, I don't think so either.

MAKAYLA
My grandfather used to tell me of all of these fishing tales
