EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC
Dalllasss - you stocking up for the storm? Life group tonight. Thanks for again for letting us use the house. Mr. Mike is home and Janice is taking care of him. Listen, I'm heading to Costco

DALLAS
No thanks - I'm good.

DOMINIC
Great - yeah. Hey Makayla! You cool here with staying here and having Dallas help out? Where's Asher. 

MAKAYLA
