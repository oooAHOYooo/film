INT. DALLAS BASEMENT

Makayla stares for a long time looking at the creature. 

MAKAYLA
(to Dallas)
I think it's dying. 

(action)
Dallas walks over and looks at the creature. He turns the dial on his receiver to a different frequency. The creature begins to perk up.

MAKAYLA
It told me that it needs to go back. 

DALLAS
Back where?

MAKAYLA 
To where you grabbed it.

(action)
The summer breeze blows through the open window. 

MAKAYLA
(to Dallas)
We are going to have to go before the red eyes take it. And take us.
