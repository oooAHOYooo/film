EXT. MAKAYLA'S LAIR 

The crew leave the sleeping creature under a heat lamp in the back corner of the wigwam type lair Makayla has created. 

Makayla gives Dallas a tour of the outdoor lair. Around a lean too structure in the woods - Makayla has built an impressive array of servillance equipment and other home-made gadgetry made from off the shelf components. 

One device in particular intrigues Dallas. 

MAKAYLA
That is a reverse audiophone - capable of taking a recording and then projecting it back into reverse. I built it last summer hoping to better understand how fish communicate.

DALLAS
And how do they?

MAKAYLA
What?

DALLAS
How do the fish communicate?

MAKAYLA
Inconclusive. 

(action)
Asher hands Dallas a small transulent crystal in the shape of a crude pyrmaid like stone. 

MAKAYLA
Asher no.

Dallas holds the object in his hands fasicanted. Makayla takes it away and pockets it.

MAKAYLA
That crystal isn't just a stone - it's a biological semi-conductor. 

(action)
Makayla stops and thinks for a moment.

MAKAYLA
Asher, what if Mr Mike's numbers wrent the coordinates we thought they were - but dial settings. 

ASHER
What do you mean?

MAKAYLA
Dallas, dial in the tune to 11.53

(action)
Dallas changes the notes of his oscillator and suddenly the creature wakes up. 





She rewinds the tapes - and finds the glow - and then the dark shadows grow on the screen and completely decimate the small creature on the ground. 

Makayla looks at the dying creature. 

MAKAYLA
Dallas - could you interpret these readings and compile in your mind or something and tell me what they mean?

(action)
Makayla hands Dallas a bunch of papers to look through. 

INT. LAIR MONTAGE
Makayla and Dallas rig up the dials - Dallas connects the Oscillator into a shoulder rig with the crystal on the center and put it on the table. 

MAKAYLA
We need to bring this to the place where you found the creature. 

Makayla turns on the prototype - and nothing happens - but suddenly the creature wakes up and begins to howl loudly - making all of the equipment in the lair act funny.

Asher clutches the creature to his chest. The creature begins to stir a bit - and Asher begins to shake to the floor. 

MAKAYLA
Asher!

(action)
Makayla runs to rescue Asher who is laying on the floor with his eyes wide open and his mouth wide open.

ASHER
Bring me back. 

(action)
Asher snaps out of it and the crew are visuably shaken. Makayla holds Asher close and whipsers that it will be alright. 

Dallas looks on and then at the equipment. Something is intriging to him.
