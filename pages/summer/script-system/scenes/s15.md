EXT. MAKAYLA'S LAIR 

Makayla gives Dallas a tour of the outdoor lair. 

Around a lean too structure in the woods - Makayla has built an impressive array of servillance equipment. 

She rewinds the tapes - and finds the glow - and then the dark shadows grow on the screen and completely decimate the small creature on the ground. 

Makayla looks at the dying creature. 

MAKAYLA
Dallas - could you interpret these readings and compile in your mind or something and tell me what they mean?

(action)
Makayla hands Dallas a bunch of papers to look through. 

Asher clutches the creature to his chest. The creature begins to stir a bit - and Asher begins to shake to the floor. 

MAKAYLA
Asher!

(action)
Makayla runs to rescue Asher who is laying on the floor with his eyes wide open and his mouth wide open.

ASHER
Bring me back. 

(action)
Asher snaps out of it and the crew are visuably shaken. Makayla holds Asher close and whipsers that it will be alright. 

Dallas looks on and then at the equipment. Something is intriging to him.
