EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - DAWN

The morning air is thick with the scent of ozone. Janice's minivan idles in the driveway. She drops Howie off, barely waving as she rushes toward the museum to secure artwork before the storm hits.

Makayla and Asher don't follow her. They wander toward the edge of Dallas's property.

MAKAYLA
Asher, look.

In the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.

Makayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.

Makayla - from the corner of her eye - and sees the creature. In a flurry she runs inside Dallas house. 


EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC
Life group tonight. Thanks for hosting. I'm heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries?

DALLAS
I'm good.

DOMINIC
Schools are canceled already. The kids are going to be underfoot all day. Try to keep 'em out of the marsh, alright?

Dominic peels out. Dallas looks at the papers, then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.


INT. DALLAS KITCHEN

Makayla stand dumbfounded looking at the creature - they can't believe it. They walk around Makayla stares at it for a good while. As if she is finally vindicated - and that her name will go ndown in all of history for finally discovering the creature of Branford.
