The crew huddle around Dallas' apartment and all sleep on the floor as Mr Mike watches a movie on TV. 

Janice makes her way through the door.

JANICE
Look at all of these sleeping beauties. Dallas, wheres Dallas. Dallas my boy - you were spared from the storm. How are you Mike. 

MR. MIKE
Things are better - things are better than what they were. Yes. 

JANICE
Thanks for letting everyone crash here Dallas.
