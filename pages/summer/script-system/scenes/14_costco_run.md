EXT. DALLAS'S PORCH - CONTINUOUS

Dominic emerges from the minivan, looking harried. He hands Dallas a stack of photocopied papers.

DOMINIC

Life group tonight. Thanks for hosting. I’m heading to Costco—need anything? Water? Batteries?

DALLAS

I’m good.

DOMINIC

Schools are canceled already. The kids are going to be underfoot all day. Try to keep ‘em out of the marsh, alright?

Dominic peels out. Dallas looks at the papers, then at the tall grass. It feels like the field is breathing.
