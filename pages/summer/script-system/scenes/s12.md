<!-- nickname: THE FIRST NIGHT WITH CREATURE  -->

INT. DALLAS DESK

Dallas is alone. And keeps peering through his late wife's old documents.

Dallas lays tiny wires on the creature's head, connecting them to his handheld. When the creature is calm, it emits a low, melodic tone through the holes in its back. HOWIE barks from the corner. The creature's holes shift—the sound becomes a sad cry, like a whimper.
