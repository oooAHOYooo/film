EXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP HALL - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in a circle with other churchgoers outside, eating at the fellowship hall.

It's the last fellowship hall lunch of the summer. Late summer light filters through the trees.

DOMINIC

This is Sally's famous casserole. You gotta try it.

DALLAS

Thanks.

Dallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted, listening.

DOMINIC

So, what are you here for?

DALLAS

Work.

DOMINIC

At Yale?

DALLAS

Quinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.

DOMINIC

Nice. So are you here alone?

DALLAS

Yep.

DOMINIC

Okay cool. That's cool.

They finish eating. The group begins to disperse.

DOMINIC

Want to walk back together? I'll show you around.

DALLAS

Sure.

They start walking towards the marsh, towards the New England coast.

In the far distance, COYOTES HOWL.
