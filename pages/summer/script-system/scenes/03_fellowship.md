EXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in heat of a picnic. Children are running, friends in light summerwear play spike ball, and people are on line getting food. Dallas looks around at all of the new faces but does not make eye contact. Dominic takes a deep breath, also appearing a little nervous. 

Dominic carries a package of water and puts it under one of the fold up tables. 

DOMINIC
Alright buddy - let's wait on line I guess. 


Dominic and Dallas wait on line to be served at fellowship lunch. 

Janice, Mid 50s, puts her hand on Dominic's shoulder.

DOMINIC
Sister.

JANICE
Brother.

DOMINIC
This is Dallas.

DALLAS
Hello.

JANICE
Hey Dallas. Dominic did you get the car?

DOMINIC
Yeah - and it had a ticket.

JANICE
Well - you can get it this time yeah? 

DOMINIC
Yep. 

Janice leaves the line of food 

JANICE
Hey Patty - How's Pete?

JANICE
Pleasure to meet you Dallas, what are you doing hanging out with my brother. 

DALLAS
Just had to go into town to get batteries. 

DOMINIC
This is Sally's famous casserole. You gotta try it.

DALLAS
Thanks.

Dallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted, listening.

DOMINIC

So, what are you here for?

DALLAS

Work.

DOMINIC

At Yale?

DALLAS

Quinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.

DOMINIC

What kind of work?

DALLAS

Bioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh—birds, insects, coyotes. I start next semester.

DOMINIC

Nice. So are you here alone?

DALLAS

Yep.

DOMINIC

Okay cool. That's cool.

They finish eating. The group begins to disperse.

DOMINIC

Want to walk back together? I'll show you around.

DALLAS

Sure.

They start walking towards the marsh, towards the New England coast.

In the far distance, COYOTES HOWL.
