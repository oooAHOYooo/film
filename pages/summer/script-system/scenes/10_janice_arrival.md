INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas is home. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.

He listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.

DALLAS
(to himself)
There.

He replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. He's not just listening anymore—he's fitting pieces together.

DALLAS
(whispering)
Forty-five left. Fifteen right.

He stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.

Another burst hits the receiver—deeper, longer. The windows don't rattle yet, but Dallas feels it in his chest. He doesn't look up. He keeps writing. Equations. Approximations. The beginning of a map only he can hear.

Outside, the marsh is dark. Inside, Dallas is wide awake, chasing a signal into the margins.
