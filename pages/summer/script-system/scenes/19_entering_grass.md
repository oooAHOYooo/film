INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - LATER

Dallas has turned his kitchen island into a triage station. He’s wired a portable oscilloscope to the creature’s head using tiny alligator clips.

The device pulses in a rhythmic, green jagged line—perfectly in sync with the creature's heartbeat.

In the distance they hear howls - and then silence again. 

The creature begins to fade - Dallas turns the dial into another frequency range and waits until it is asleep. 

Makayla 
(to Dallas)
What does that do?

Dallas
(whispering)
It changes the frequency I am transmitting.

Makayla
And you think that it somehow is like talking to the creature?

Dallas
Yes. 

Asher comes in the room and gathers around the creature as well. 

Dallas adjusts the dial on his military receiver to a 115.3 MHz frequency. The creature's breathing stabilizes. It lets out a low, melodic tone through its back-holes.

<!-- [ADDITION] Makayla identifies the secondary wave — the creature is drawing power from the grid -->
Makayla leans over the oscilloscope. She points at the screen.

MAKAYLA
Wait. Look at that.

Behind the creature's smooth sine wave, a second signal appears—jagged, arrhythmic. It pulses in sharp, irregular bursts, riding underneath the creature's frequency like static beneath music.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
That's not coming from the creature. That's a draw. It's pulling power.

She looks at Dallas.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
The substation on Route 146 is already hum-cycling. I heard the transformers buzzing on the way over. If this frequency keeps expanding...

She trails off. Dallas stares at the secondary wave on the screen. He doesn't answer, but the implication is clear: this isn't contained to the backyard anymore.
<!-- [/ADDITION] -->

Howie sits in the corner, head cocked, shivering. Outside, the world responds: the windows rattle, and a deep, distant hum echoes from the town center.
