INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Families arrive in waves. The small kitchen and smaller living room fill. The crowd tries Dominic's toasted Brussels sprouts, passed around on paper plates.

Makayla drifts through the kitchen. She opens drawers quietly. Finds sugar cubes meant for coffee. Pockets one without a word.

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - SAME TIME

Dallas shuffles through a pile of old equipment—mono cables, spare parts. The creature doesn't look like it's doing much. It's breathing, slightly. Dallas struggles to find a bed for it. He settles on an old shoebox—pauses when he sees his wife's handwriting on one, sets that aside—and gently nestles the creature inside. Its little feet curl tightly. It breathes slowly.



He finds a way to poke a hole in something so it can drink. MAKAYLA and ASHER watch from the staircase. Makayla comes down. She takes out the crystal. It begins to glow. Her hair lifts. She and the creature seem to communicate—a beat of shared attention. The creature's glow dims as she pulls her hand away.



INT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

People mill and talk. Someone asks where Dallas is.



DOMINIC
We found a little cat. Dallas is downstairs nursing it.

A woman stands—early fifties, warm.

WOMAN
I'm a vet. I could take a look.

DOMINIC
I mean— no, that's okay. I think that cat's just sleeping. We could check after?

An elderly woman nods. Everyone agrees. Someone asks how Howie is doing—where is Howie. JOSH, one of the young couples, leads the group. 

He starts an opening ice breaker. Dallas, Dominic, Makayla, and Asher sit silent. 

(action)
SARAH, the vet, notices a physical reaction to her cup of tea - and watches it ripple in a strange way. 

TYLER, a young man with a guitar, hands out music sheets.

TYLER
Something to settle the nerves. Storm's close.

They begin to sing a hymn. As the voices rise, the hum from the basement begins to rise with them.

<!-- [ADDITION] Lights dim in rhythm with creature + Sarah's tea ripples — visual proof of acoustic parasite -->
The overhead lights dim in time with the creature's harmonics—a slow pulse that matches the rhythm of the hymn. Sarah's tea ripples in her cup, concentric rings expanding outward in perfect time.
<!-- [/ADDITION] -->

The hum starts to upset people as it becomes unbearable.

Subtle at first. Then undeniable. The floorboards vibrate. <!-- [ADDITION] -->The lights pulse lower and lower. <!-- [/ADDITION] -->People look at each other.

AMY
What was that?

(action)
The group listen in silence.

PAT CLENDENEN
Must be the wind. Pressure's dropping fast.

Dallas stares at the basement door. The sound isn't the wind. It's an answer.

During a silent moment of reflection, the hum starts again. Everyone is unsettled. What was that noise? The group settles on the weird weather—the storm, the patterns plaguing Branford. 

In time, people leave. Hugs. Goodbyes. Dominic waves them out. He waits for the last person to leave. Then he rushes downstairs with the kids.
