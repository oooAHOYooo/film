EXT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATE DAY (STORM)

The sun sets. The crew peer out at the yard and the tall grass.

DOMINIC
Let's have some dinner.

He wipes the counter hard. A cup tips over. Mr. Mike nods from his chair.

MR. MIKE
Good time to eat.

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Dominic and Asher cook. Makayla and Dallas share a glance at the window—Dallas watching the weather, the perimeter, the grass.

They eat standing, plates in hand, taking turns at the window. Outside, the noise grows. Sniffs. Gnarls. The creatures. Makayla rattles in her chair, impatient.

MAKAYLA
What should we do?

Dominic looks defeated. Dallas says nothing. Mr. Mike rocks in his chair, muttering. He taps the same three beats on the armrest, over and over.

MR. MIKE
One-one-five point three. One-one-five point three.

Dominic is hesitant. He asks Dallas for answers about the field. Dallas doesn't have them. Dominic argues they should focus on boarding up the house for the storm.

As he speaks—Makayla bolts. She runs out the back door, cutting across the yard toward the reeds before anyone can grab her.

The sound spikes once. Sharper. Shorter. Then it cuts.

Makayla snatches the crystal from her pocket and sprints. Dominic chases her. He can't reach her in time. He hesitates at the edge of the tall grass. He cries her name. Asher and Dallas reach the grass and stare.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas powers on the makeshift poles. Howie cowers next to him. Mr. Mike watches from the window. Dominic rushes past for flashlights. He tries to call Makayla on the two-way radio—Asher has the other walkie. Dominic tells Dallas to watch Mr. Mike and Howie. He hesitates, then heads into the grass.

Dallas waits with Howie on the porch. He watches his equipment. The blinking orange light turns green. He hurries over to inspect. The indicator: green, then orange pulses.

The storm approaches. The two of them pace. Mr. Mike, inside, hears the thunder and yells.

MR. MIKE
They're coming! They're coming!

Dallas secures the fence. A distant cry. Then the low hum. Night falls. The winds pick up. Eyes circulate in the fields. Dominic grabs Dallas's sleeve. Dallas pulls free without turning around.

Dallas brings Howie inside. He sets the leash on the hook like he'll be back in a minute. He rubs Howie's face. Leaves the porch light on. Then he heads out to the tall grass.

EXT. TALL GRASS - NIGHT

A strange silence engulfs Dallas despite the wind. He sees a glimmer of fading light and moves toward it. The sensation of being watched almost overwhelms him. He keeps going.

He stops. Pulls a crumpled napkin from his pocket. Opens it: 45 L 15 R. It matches his equipment. The compass on the device.

In the distance: Makayla, holding one of the creatures. Asher and Dominic sit next to her, dazed. Makayla's eyes are fading as Dallas approaches. In her hands, the creature makes its calls. Little by little, dark eyes appear around them. Another creature of the same size emerges and begins to nurture the one she holds.

Dallas makes contact with the creature. The creature begins to sing. The crew are paralyzed—and so are the dark forces. They cower away. The storm rages. The creatures retreat into their holes in the gnarls of the soft trees.

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATE NIGHT / DAWN

Dallas, Dominic, and Makayla sit by the window and watch for the night to end. It does.

EXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - MORNING

Morning. Dallas is still making calculations. Then he stops. He puts his equipment in the trash. The crew leaves. Dallas is alone again.

He looks outside. The soft sound—the pulse of the creature—returns. Faint. There. He listens.
