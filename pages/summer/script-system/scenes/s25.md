# Scene 25: Into the Marsh
<!-- summary: First confrontation with Dark Creatures. Distinctive weird marks. They have to rescue the light. -->

EXT. EDGE OF THE TALL GRASS

Dallas, Makayla and Asher all stand before the edge of the tallgrass with the shoulder rig device. 

They all take a deep breath as the winds pick up. And enter.

EXT. INSIDE THE TALLGRASS

Dallas, Makayla, and Asher push through the reeds. The same glow they saw before—flickering, faint. They rush toward it. 

Makayla and Dalls find the creature in the middle of the gnarl where Dallas found it initially.

The creature’s pulse is slowing. The glow in its neck dims into a faint amber. 

Dallas reaches out, his fingers trembling. As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.

He notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.

As Dallas lifts the fragile creature toward his chest, it looks out and cries for the crystal—in vain. It faints. The scope in his pocket goes silent.

Suddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the reeds—something massive, rocketing through the blades like an arrow. Dallas gently lowers the creature to the ground.

Behind them it seems like dark chaos is errupting.

In the dark scary chaos that is beyond them - little by little faint pulses of golden light begin to swarm the creature. 

As they inch closer, they see them: a group of creatures, birdlike and small, gathered in a loose circle. They are attending to the injured one—the one from the shoebox. Gentle, urgent.

Dallas and Makayla slow. Asher whines and grabs his head on the floor. The creatures turn and look at Asher in distress. One of them shakes its head and Asher's breathing comes back to normal. 

Suddenly and just then dark figures appear in the distance and the hum begins faintly.

Inch by icnch the hum draws closer.

MAKAYLA
(whispering)
Asher, turn it on. 

(action)
Asher turns on the device that is strapped to Makayla's shouder. He turns it up all the way the dial and plugs in the numbers 1, 1, 5, 3. 

The dark creatures begin to swarm the crowd from the edge of a radius among the tall grass. 

Dallas and Makayla hold their arms in pain.
