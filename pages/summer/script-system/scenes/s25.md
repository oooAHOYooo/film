INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - DAY

MR. MIKE barges through the front door. MAKAYLA chases after him.

MR. MIKE
Where is it? Where is it?

He searches the kitchen, the hall, haphazard. Makayla makes desperate eye contact with DALLAS, who is by the window with his equipment.


EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Makayla watches from a distance. She walks over. She doesn't ask permission. She picks up the second receiver and starts scanning frequencies alongside him. Dallas's reading on the handheld jumps. He looks over. A beat. He acknowledges her.

They work in silence—listening, adjusting, mapping the signal. Makayla pulls out Sierra's folder and cross-references a frequency notation with what's on screen. A match.

MAKAYLA
What happened?

Dallas doesn't answer. Makayla reads his face.

MAKAYLA
The creature?

(action)
Dallas nods. Makayla grabs his device off the table. DOMINIC appears and grabs her wrist. The three of them stand there. From the direction of the marsh—a cry. Distant, unmistakable. The creature. Then the hum, low and everywhere.

Makayla pulls free. She turns to both of them. Her eyes dart in the direction of the tall grass on the edge of Dallas' yard. 

A beat. Dallas stares at her.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
We have to go back.

Dallas looks at the tall grass. At the reading. At her. Then toward the house—Howie. They grab him and start down the trail.

EXT. MARSH TRAIL - LATER

Dallas, Makayla, and Howie push through the reeds. The same glow they saw before—flickering, faint. They rush toward it. 

The trail leads toward the salt marsh. As they inch closer, they see them: a group of creatures, birdlike and small, gathered in a loose circle. They are attending to the injured one—the one from the shoebox. Gentle, urgent.

Dallas and Makayla slow. Howie whines. The creatures have not yet scattered. For a moment, it looks like help. Like a family.
