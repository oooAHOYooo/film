EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves.

A cry rings out. It’s not a throat-sound; it’s air being forced through something hollow. 

Dallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.

A flickering glow emanates from its neck. Its "back-holes"—delicate vents along its spine—vibrate as it breathes, creating the sound that syncs perfectly with Dallas's receiver.
