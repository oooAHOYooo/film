INT. DALLAS DESK - NIGHT

Dallas is peered over his computer and begins to look at the recordings of the day. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.

He listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.

He replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. 

He stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.

As he is listening another burst hits the ongoing recording. Dallas looks up from his desk and peers outside. Another faint glow.
