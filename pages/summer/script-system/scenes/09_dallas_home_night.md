INT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The house smells like old wood and floor wax. Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall.

As they move - Dominic knocks over a photo frame - and Dallas grabs it. On the ground is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.

DOMINIC
My wife and kid. They're... gone now.

(action)
Dallas sheepisly looks at Dominic.

DOMINIC
What about you?

DALLAS
What do you mean?

DOMINIC
Have you have someone that you've lost?

DALLAS
No, I've never really had anyone. 

Dominic looks toward the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged fingernail.

DOMINIC 
Mr. Mike. I take care of him now. He's had a rough go since the weather changed... He doesn't like it at all. 

Dominic moves to the window and shuts the blinds halfway, like he's done it a thousand times.

Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a gnarled finger at the window.

MR. MIKE
She's here.

(action)
Dominic is already moving—trying to calm him, trying to stop him.

Mr. Mike scratches faster. Dallas leans in and catches the numbers before Dominic blocks his view.

MR. MIKE 

Forty-five left. Fifteen right.

Dallas freezes. Dominic flips the end table over—the scratchpad numbers disappear against the floorboards.

MR. MIKE

Dominic. 

DOMINIC

Yes Mr. Mike

MR.MIKE
Your sister is here!
