EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

Dominic arrives to pick up Howie.

Dominic
Hey man - sorry for the crazy day - things got a little out of hand didn't they?

DALLAS
It was okay.

DOMINIC
Great - do you think you could watch Howie tomorrow afternoon?

DALLAS
Um

DOMINIC
It's okay - think about it... Hey - tomorrow - Listen - we got a free picnic - we should all go.

DALLAS
What time

DOMINIC
Around 3 - or 4 - or 5 - not sure - but I'll ring you - we'll go.

DALLAS
Sounds good.

(action)
Dominic picks back Howie up.

INT. DALLAS DESK - NIGHT

Dallas is peered over his computer and begins to look at the recordings of the day. 

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas is home. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.

He listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.

DALLAS
(to himself)
There.

He replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. He's not just listening anymore—he's fitting pieces together.

DALLAS
(whispering)
Forty-five left. Fifteen right.

He stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.

Another burst hits the receiver—deeper, longer. The windows don't rattle yet, but Dallas feels it in his chest. He doesn't look up. He keeps writing. Equations. Approximations. The beginning of a map only he can hear.

Outside, the marsh is dark. Inside, Dallas is wide awake, chasing a signal into the margins.
