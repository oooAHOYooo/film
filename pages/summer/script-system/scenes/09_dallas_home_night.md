<!-- [DELETION] Kitchen triage — cut through mud room to EXT. DALLAS HOUSE; this repeats in Scenes 17/18 -->
INT. DALLAS KITCHEN

As it cries out - Dallas' equipment begins to pulse and spike. 

Dallas is alone and it is getting dark. He dashes back home with the creature - and scopes Howie - who is not having a good time. Dallas rushes the creature over to the kitchen and upstairs to examine further. 

Dallas is alone with the creature trying to understand it. He puts it on a gentle pan with parchment paper - and begins to look through big jewerly glasses - as to see what is wrong with it. 

The creature is asleep and Dallas notices that it has blood marks underneath its top wing. 

Dallas treats the wound and then gently brings it outside. But as he does - he notices that the creature communicates somehow with the oscillators in the kitchen. 

INT. DALLAS MUD ROOM

He brings it back inside and begins to record it with and hears a bell ring. 

Dallas walks outside with the creature in his hand. As he does so Dominic catches him.

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

DOMINIC
Hey man - sorry I'm late - how's Howie?

(action)
Howie runs up to him. 

DOMINIC
Great - do you think you could him tomorrow as well?

DALLAS
Um

DOMINIC
It's okay - think about it... Hey - tomorrow - Listen - we got a free picnic - we should all go.

DALLAS
What time

DOMINIC
Around 3 - or 4 - or 5 - not sure - but I'll ring you - we'll go.

DALLAS
Sounds good.

(action)
Dominic picks back Howie up.

INT. DALLAS DESK - NIGHT

Dallas is peered over his computer and begins to look at the recordings of the day. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.

Dallas as he is reading on computer - is holding a little sringe of chemicals that he hopes will replinish the creature. 

He listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.

He replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. 

He stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.

His elbow brushes the stack of Sierra's folders. One slides open—a corner of a sketch visible. Something with wings. He pushes it closed without looking. 

As he is listening another burst hits the ongoing recording. Dallas looks up from his desk and peers outside. Another faint glow. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN
Dallas makes his way to the creature. 

Dallas looks at the creature - who is appearing to be drinking water and eating the grass - but is still sleeping inside of a gnarl of the aquarium Dallas has obviously made for it. 

Howie is in the corner of the room looking like he is going to pee. Dallas looks at Howie.
