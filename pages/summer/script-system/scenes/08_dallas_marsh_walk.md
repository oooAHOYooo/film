EXT. MARSH TRAIL - EVENING

Dallas walks home with Howie. 

Dallas walks with Howie along the coastal trail. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the tall grass. He carries his portable receiver, the dials clicking softly as he adjusts the frequency.

The air is still, too still. No birds. No wind. Just the distant sound of unseen water lapping against the shore.

Dallas steps off the boardwalk onto a narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh.

There in the distance he sees a distubrance. He walks over to a makeshift trap with a trailcam over it. He notices that it is wired to a solar pack and away from itself. Howie runs up to it and smells it. 

EXT. MARSH ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS

Dallas stops at the creek's edge and pans his gaze towards the outer marsh. The tall grass stretches endlessly before him, golden-yellow reeds swaying gently despite the lack of wind.

His equipment begins to beep. Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern.

Howie begins to bark a little - and Dallas stops him 
He clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy.

From the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas notices it—but it's gone.

Dallas takes a step forward, then another. The reeds part before him, closing behind him as he disappears into the tall grass.

EXT. TALL GRASS - CONTINUOUS

The reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through, his receiver spiking with each step. The hum grows louder, more insistent.

He stops. Listens. Something is moving in the grass ahead of him—something large, moving against the wind.

He stands slowly, scanning the reeds around him. Nothing. Just the gentle sway of grass and the sound of his own breathing.

Dallas turns and begins to make his way back, the receiver still recording, still searching for a signal that has vanished as quickly as it appeared.
