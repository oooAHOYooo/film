EXT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - NIGHT (STORM)

The storm hits. Dallas, Dominic, and Asher are in the yard, battling the wind. Dallas jams heavy metal poles into the mud at ten-foot intervals.

DALLAS

Asher! The wire!

They string heavy copper wire between the poles, creating a makeshift Faraday fence. Dallas connects his military receiver to the circuit. As he powers it on, the orange indicator light turns green. The perimeter is live.
