EXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - LATER

They arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.

DOMINIC

Those damn raccoons! I just put these out!

Dominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at his front door, then at Dallas.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)

Look, I gotta clean this up and get the furniture moved before the life group meeting tonight. The kids left the place a wreck. You mind helping me move the heavy sofa? I’ll buy you a beer.

DALLAS

(hesitates)

Sure. Just for a minute.
