EXT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - LATER

They arrive back at Dominic's. Two large plastic trash bins are sprawled across the driveway, trash strewn everywhere.

DOMINIC
Those damn raccoons! I just put these out!

Dominic kicks a stray milk carton. He looks at his front door, then at Dallas.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)
Look, I gotta clean this up and get the furniture moved before the men's group tonight. I got to go check on Mike and bring in another AC unit from the basement. You busy? 

DALLAS
(hesitates)
Sure. 

INT. DOMINIC'S BASEMENT 
Dallas and Dominic move an AC unit - as they go to install it - Dallas notices a strange burn mark on the ground near the tall grass. 

He walks over to it and examines it - he brings out his oscillator and then begins to record it a bit. The readings are off.
