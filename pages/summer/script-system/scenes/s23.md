INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - HALL / DEN - NIGHT

Dallas is wide awake. Candle shadows dance across the hall. He checks a small video feed of the creature in the den downstairs—temperature, frequency of the earth, the hum of the box. He picks up the tape recorder sitting next to him on his desk. Presses play.

His late wife's voice. Her theories. The great hum—something she read about as a girl. A long narration. Why she had to stop. He listens.

Dallas looks back to the video monitor, and raises from the bed - the creature is gone!

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT (SAME)

Dallas looks out the tall window toward the marsh while holding the empty cardboard box. His hair blows in the wind. In the distance: a pair of eyes. Bright. Dim. Bright. Red. He looks across the past a telephone pole with a red eyes. Something down the block glows red. He looks back at the tall grass. The red eyes are gone.

He looks again. Closer. The eyes reappear. Swirling through the blades of grass. Watching the house. Little pulses of red light. Inch by inch. Closer to the edge of the yard.

Dallas looks at the burn mark on his forearm - it begins to glow a bit - and then as it does - more howls in the distance engulf the screen.
