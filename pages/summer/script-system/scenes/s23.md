INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - HALL / DEN - NIGHT

Dallas is wide awake. Candle shadows dance across the hall. He checks a small video feed of the creature in the den downstairs—temperature, frequency of the earth, the hum of the box. He picks up the tape recorder sitting next to him on his desk. Presses play.

His late wife's voice. Her theories. The great hum—something she read about as a girl. A long narration. Why she had to stop. He listens.

<!-- [ADDITION] Dallas finally opens Sierra's folder — leaves it visible for Makayla to find -->
As the tape plays, Dallas's hand drifts to the stack of Sierra's folders beside the recorder. He opens one. Inside: her sketches—the same creatures, drawn with anatomical precision. Frequency notations in the margins. A map of the marsh. He's seen them before but never looked. He looks now. He closes the folder and sets it on top of the box—visible, accessible.

Dallas looks back to the video monitor but the creature is gone!

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT (SAME)

Dallas looks out the tall window toward the marsh. In the distance: a pair of eyes. Bright. Dim. Bright. Red. He looks across the street—the telephone pole has a red light. Something down the block glows red. He looks back at the tall grass. The red eyes are gone.

He looks again. Closer. The eyes reappear. Swirling through the blades of grass. Watching the house. Little pulses of red light. Inch by inch. Closer to the edge of the yard.

Dallas looks at the burn mark on his forearm - it begins to glow a bit - and then as it does - more howls in the distance engulf the screen.

INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT / DEN - NIGHT

Dallas makes his way downstairs to check on the creature. The makeshift box is empty. The creature is gone.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas at the window again. The eyes are gone. The night is still.
