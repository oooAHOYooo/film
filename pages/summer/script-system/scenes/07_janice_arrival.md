INT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

The front door slams open. JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. Behind her, ASHER (15) and MAKAYLA (22) trudge in, staring at their phones.

Dallas is at the entrance of the doorway and makes room for it. 

JANICE
(spitting out keys)
The traffic on I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why are you cooking the sprouts already? They'll be mush by the time the group gets here.

DOMINIC
I'm following the recipe, Janice.

JANICE
(inspecting the pot)
You're boiling them? You're supposed to roast them! And the gravy—is that a lump?

Janice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas's heavy receiver on the floor.

JANICE 
What is this? A boat anchor?

DALLAS
It's a receiver. For work.

INT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Makayla stops by Dallas's equipment. She doesn't look at it with Janice's annoyance; she looks with genuine curiosity.

MAKAYLA
This is military grade. What are you tracking?

DALLAS
Bioacoustics. Sounds in the marsh.

MAKAYLA
Does it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung.

Asher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.

DOMINIC
(yelling from the door)
Everyone in the car! We're going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!

The family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.
