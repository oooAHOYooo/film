EXT. EDGE OF TALL GRASS - DAY

The crew watches from a distance. In the marsh: a battle of pulse and shadow. The red-eyed creatures surround the small ones. They devour them. A mirage of flickering yellow lights against the red. Then it all stops.

The bad creatures turn. They seek the humans.

DOMINIC
Run.

They run out of the tall grass and don't stop until they're home.

EXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATER

Dallas sits in the kitchen, silent. Then he gets up. No debate. He goes outside and starts digging.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Dallas jams heavy poles into the mud. He takes copper wire and hangs it between them. He pauses, moves one pole back a few feet, checks the meter again.

MAKAYLA paces the distance between poles with heel-to-toe steps. The tone on the receiver drops—spreading wider but losing strength.

ASHER gives Dominic a tour of the equipment, explaining what each component does. Asher reaches for the dial, then pulls his hand back when it squeals.

The storm rolls in. Makayla runs toward JANICE. Mr. Mike, Asher, and Dominic are outside. Dallas looks stunned, staring into the tall grass. He keeps going—poles, wire. Dominic, without a word, begins to help him.

Dallas examines the perimeter. A small radio plays—PAT CLENDENEN from the news van, welcoming Branford to a beautiful southern New England morning. The contrast is cruel.

Dallas jams the last pole into the mud. The crew stare at the tall grass. The decision is unspoken: leave the creature. Dallas and Makayla dig. Soon: the crawl of fire engines in the distance. Sea birds. And then the hum.

Dallas walks back to the house. The crew follows. They wait on the porch. The perimeter is up. The storm is here.

DOMINIC
This is crazy. What are we doing here.

No one answers.
