INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - NIGHT

The crew sits at the table in the vibrating house. Dominic and Asher have cooked a silent meal. They eat with their eyes on the windows.

The sound of sniffs and gnarls echoes from the porch. Makayla rattles in her chair. In the corner, Mr. Mike rocks back and forth, his voice a rhythmic chant.

MR. MIKE

One-one-five point three. One-one-five point three.

Suddenly, Makayla snaps. She runs out the door, straight into the tall grass. Dominic and Dallas scramble after her, disappearing into the screaming wind.
