EXT. BRANFORD STREET - DAY

Dallas walks into town for batteries. On the way, he meets his neighbor DOMINIC.

DOMINIC

Hey there! 

DALLAS

Hey. 

DOMINIC

You just moved in? You must know the real estate agent. 



DOMINIC

Dominic. Nice to meet you. Heading into town?

DALLAS

Just need batteries.

DOMINIC

I'll walk with you. Got some errands myself.

They walk together. As they approach the town center, Dallas notices a row of BIRDS perched on a power line. All facing the direction towards the marsh.

DALLAS

That's... unusual.

DOMINIC

What?

DALLAS

The birds. All facing the same direction.

DOMINIC

(shrugs)

Coastal birds. They do that.

But Dallas can't shake the feeling. Something's off.
