EXT. DALLAS HOUSE - DAY
Dallas walks outside. 


EXT. BRANFORD STREET - DAY

Dallas walks into town for batteries. On the way, he meets his neighbor DOMINIC.

DOMINIC
Neighbor! 

DALLAS
Hey. 

DOMINIC
What you doing?

DALLAS
Heading to town to get batteries.

DOMINIC
You don't got a car?

DALLAS
No - no car.

DOMINIC
Yeah - my sister's borrowing mine. I have the extra set of keys though and need to go pick it up downtown - hey - we should walk together. 

DOMINIC
I'll walk with you. Got some errands myself.

EXT. TOWN BRANFORD MONTAGE 

Dallas and Dominic walk together. They walk through coastal scenes, and neighborhoods, and sidewalks. As they approach one in particular - a patch of tall marsh grass - Dallas stops. 

Dallas, sheepisly, checks if Dominic is looking and when he isn't - he pulls out a pocket recorder - and points it at the marsh. 

DOMINIC
What's with the toy. 

DALLAS
Oh, it's an audio recorder. 

DOMINIC
Be careful - there are coyotoes up in that. 

Dallas continues to record. 

DOMINIC 
Common champ - we're going to be late.
