EXT. MARSH TRAIL - EVENING

Dallas walks home with Howie. 

Dallas walks with Howie along the coastal trail. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the tall grass. He carries his portable receiver, the dials clicking softly as he adjusts the frequency.

Dallas stops at the creek's edge and pans his gaze towards the outer marsh. The tall grass stretches endlessly before him, golden-yellow reeds swaying gently despite the lack of wind.

The air is still, too still. No birds. No wind. Just the distant sound of unseen water lapping against the shore.

Dallas steps off the boardwalk onto a narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh.

There in the distance he sees a distubrance. He walks over to a makeshift trap with a trailcam over it. He notices that it is wired to a solar pack and away from itself. 



His equipment begins to beep. Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern.

Howie begins to bark a little - and Dallas stops him 
He clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy.

From the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas notices it—but it's gone.

Dallas takes a step forward, then another. The reeds part before him, closing behind him as he disappears into the tall grass.

He stands slowly, scanning the reeds around him. Nothing. Just the gentle sway of grass and the sound of his own breathing.

Dallas turns and begins to make his way back, the receiver still recording.

<!-- [DELETION] Double discovery — Dallas finds creature here AND in Scenes 13–15; end scene at the golden flicker instead -->
There he sees a faint glow - as he approaches he notices that there is a group of biolumniset creatures huddling around the gnarl of an old tree. 

Dallas in a daze follows it. 


The creature is biolumenist - much like a firefly - the other creatures scatter into the marsh as if they were little orbs of golden light - but remains is one, smaller than the rest, injured and letting a cry out. 

As Dallas approaches the other creatures scatter away - and Dallas looks around - all of a sudden it is silent. The silence engulfs him all he hears is his own breath and the creatures - and the silence comes in waves. 

Dallas tkes the creature in his hand and slowly walks away fast - out of the reeds - he grabs howie and nervoulsy walks back home throug hthe edge of the tall grass - through his sidewalk - back to his backyard - up the stairs of the kitchen - and through the kitchen.
