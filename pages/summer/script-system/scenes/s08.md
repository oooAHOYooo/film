EXT. MARSH TRAIL - EVENING

Dallas walks home with Howie. 

Dallas walks with Howie along the coastal trail. The sun is setting, casting long shadows across the tall grass. He carries his portable receiver, the dials clicking softly as he adjusts the frequency.

Dallas stops at the creek's edge and pans his gaze towards the outer marsh. The tall grass stretches endlessly before him, golden-yellow reeds swaying gently despite the lack of wind.

The air is still, too still. No birds. No wind. Just the distant sound of unseen water lapping against the shore.

Dallas steps off the boardwalk onto a narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh.

There in the distance he sees a distubrance. He walks over to a makeshift trap with a trailcam over it. He notices that it is wired to a solar pack and away from itself. 



His equipment begins to beep. Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern.

Howie begins to bark a little - and Dallas stops him 
He clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy.

From the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. Dallas notices it—but it's gone.

Dallas takes a step forward, then another. The reeds part before him, closing behind him as he disappears into the tall grass.

He stands slowly, scanning the reeds around him. Nothing. Just the gentle sway of grass and the sound of his own breathing.

Dallas steps deeper, following the fading glow.

In a shallow hollow, a cluster of bioluminescent creatures huddle around the gnarl of an old tree—little orbs of gold, pulsing like lanterns.

As Dallas approaches, the lights scatter into the reeds.

One remains. Smaller than the rest. Injured. It lets out a thin cry that makes the scope needle jump.

Dallas looks around. All at once the marsh is silent. The silence comes in waves—pressing, releasing.

He scoops the injured creature into his hands.

The air changes.

A heavy, crushing sound slices through the reeds—something massive rocketing toward him like an arrow.

DALLAS
(to himself)
Go, go, go.

Dallas breaks into a sprint. He reaches the stunted cedar tree—HOWIE is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass.

Dallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is far behind them.

At the edge of his driveway, he finally stops—gasping. The creature is motionless in his coat, but its neck glow pulses weak, fading amber.
