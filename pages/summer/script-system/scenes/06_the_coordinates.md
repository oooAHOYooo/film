INT. DOMINIC'S BASEMENT 
Dallas and Dominic move an AC unit - as they go to install it. 

He walks over to it and examines it - he brings out his oscillator and then begins to record it a bit. The readings are off.

INT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM 

Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall. As they move - Dominic knocks over a photo frame - and Dallas grabs it. On the ground is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.

DOMINIC
My wife and kid... Gone now. Dallas grab the leg

(action)
Dallas grabs the leg of the table and pushes. The two look at the table for a while. 

DOMINIC
What about you?

DALLAS
What do you mean?

DOMINIC
Have you have someone that you've lost?

(action)
Dallas falls mute. Dominic scans the room and finds his gaze upon the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged nail.

DOMINIC 
Mr. Mike! Hey - what are you doing? 

(action)
Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a finger at the window.

MR. MIKE
She's here! Hey Dominic! Look - she's here.

DOMINIC
Whose hear? Why are you scratching the table?

MR. MIKE
Your sister.

(action)
Dominic dashes for the door and opens it. In pops Janice with Makayla and Asher. 

Dallas meanwhile walks towards Mr. Mike before Dominic blocks his view.

MR. MIKE 
Forty-five left. Fifteen right. She's here - Dominic - Janice is here - ASHER! - it is playing the same one Elena chased. 

(action)
Asher rushes over to Mr. Mike and eye's widen when he see's what he has been writing. Asher runs to Makayla - who starts to jot the numbers on the table on her palm. 


INT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. 

JANICE
Traffic the I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why aren't you cooking the sprouts already? We need to boil them first and then sear them. Last time you just boiled them and it was a disgusting mush... Hi Dallas. 

DOMINIC
You got it Janice. Anything for the brussels.  

JANICE
Okay.

(action)

Janice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas's heavy receiver on the floor.

JANICE 
What is this? A boat anchor?

DALLAS
It's a receiver. For work.

(action)
Mr. Mike in the distance begins to get agitated

MR. Mike
And when you hurt one - eventually they will transform into the other one - they wont stay kind forever. If the winds get them - they will take charge.

(action)
Janice walks over and grabs Howie from the car and hands them to Dallas.

JANICE
Do you mind watching Howie for a bit this afternoon - I have to take everyone to costco

(action)
Dallas looks at the dog - the dog Howie looks back at the man Dallas. Makayla walks over and grabs the portable Oscillator holding in Dallas' hand. 

MAKAYLA
Have you given any thought to what I asked you the other day?

(action)
Dallas looks at Makayla and back at Asher

MAKAYLA
Let my brother borrow it. 

(action)
Asher walks over to Mr. Mike to see how he is doing. Makayla approaches Dallas even further. 

MAKAYLA
Does it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung. <!-- [ADDITION] Makayla connects hum to grid — she's already observing the pattern -->And the streetlights on our block were doing that thing again—cycling on and off. Every time I hear the sound, the lights go weird.<!-- [/ADDITION] -->

(action)
Asher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.

DOMINIC
(yelling from the door)
Everyone in the car! We're going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!

The family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.
