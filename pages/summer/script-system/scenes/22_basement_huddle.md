INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

Dallas has moved the creature to a shoebox lined with one of his wife’s old sweatshirts. Makayla and Asher crouch beside it.

MAKAYLA

It’s beautiful.

She pulls the sugar cube from her pocket and places it near the creature’s mouth. She takes out her crystal; as it nears the creature, the crystal glows brighter, and Makayla’s hair begins to lift in the static.

ASHER

Is it... talking to us?

DALLAS

It’s vibrating. It’s operating on a different timeline.

A floorboard creaks above. The "Life Group" is growing. They can hear the muffled sounds of small talk and chairs scraping.
