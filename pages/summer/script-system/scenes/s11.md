INT. DALLAS KITCHEN

The creature cries out - Dallas' equipment begins to pulse and spike. 

Dallas is alone and it is getting dark. He dashes back home with the creature - and scopes Howie - who is not having a good time. Dallas rushes the creature over to the kitchen and upstairs to examine further. 

Dallas is alone with the creature trying to understand it. He puts it on a gentle pan with parchment paper - and begins to look through big jewerly glasses - as to see what is wrong with it. 

The creature is asleep and Dallas notices that it has marks underneath its top wing. 

Dallas treats the wound and then gently brings it outside. But as he does - he notices that the creature communicates somehow with the oscillators in the kitchen. 

INT. DALLAS MUD ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas begins to make his way outside with his audio equipment - but is stopped when he hears the creatures cry. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Dallas approaches it - and notices that he creature, though still seemingly asleep - seems to lay out a cry 



INT. DALLAS DESK - NIGHT

Dallas is peered over his computer and begins to look at the recordings of the day. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.

Dallas as he is reading on computer - is holding a little sringe of chemicals that he hopes will replinish the creature. 

He listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.

He replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. 

He stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.

His elbow brushes the stack of Sierra's folders. One slides open—a corner of a sketch visible. Something with wings. He pushes it closed without looking. 

As he is listening another burst hits the ongoing recording. Dallas looks up from his desk and peers outside. Another faint glow. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN
Dallas makes his way to the creature. 

Dallas looks at the creature - who is appearing to be drinking water and eating the grass - but is still sleeping inside of a gnarl of the aquarium Dallas has obviously made for it. 


INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.

Dallas goes to look at the creature in his makeshift box. It is breathing. Dallas begins to examine all of the blood - it seems to have darkened. 

He touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long.

The hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames. <!-- [ADDITION] Interior light drain — the creature is pulling current from the house -->
The overhead light dims—not a flicker, but a slow, steady drain, as if something is pulling the current out of the walls. Then it returns to full brightness.
<!-- [/ADDITION] -->

A doorbell is heard off screen breaking Dallas out of his trance.

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dallas opens the door to find Asher and Makayla.

DOMINIC
Thank you for watching Howie - how did he do? 

DALLAS
Good

(action)
Asher looks behind Dallas at all of the equipment. Dallas hands Howie over to Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Okay - we'll - we'll be on our way. Hey - are you still okay with hosting lifegroup on Thursday

Dallas
Yeah. 

DOMINIC
Okay... Hey - everything okay?

DALLAS
Yeah - sorry - I'm just a little tired. 

DOMINIC
Alright well rest well big guy. 

(action)
Asher and Dominic and Howie leave and walk into the next side door. Dallas watches them - and then watches the tall grass sway in the wind. 

Dallas rushes to the kitchen and finds that the creature is doing good.
