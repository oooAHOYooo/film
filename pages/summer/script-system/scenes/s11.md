# Scene 11: Kitchen Triage
<!-- summary: He runs home with it. Kitchen triage—parchment, macro lens. The creature cries; the equipment flares gold. -->
EXT. COSTAL NEIGHBORHOOD JOURNEY 
Dallas is alone and the evening is getting dark. He dashes back through the coastal neighborhoods with the creature in his jacket - and urges the dog Howie to walk faster - who is not having a good time. Dallas rushes the creature over to the kitchen and upstairs to examine further. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN - DUSK
Dallas rushes to bring the creature inside. He grabs an aluminion pan and lines it with parchment paper. The creature seems to be asleep. 

Howie barks outside. Dallas rushes to grab him.

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER
Howie is in the living room couch very nervous and peering out the window. The camera pans and finds alone with the creature trying to understand it as he observes its features with thick macro monoculars. 

As Dallas peers closer, he notices that it has marks underneath its top wing. As Dallas touches the marks the creature suddenly wakes up and lets out a cry.

As the creature cries - Dallas notices that all of the screens on his equipment turn slowly into golden static. The hue gets so vibrant and bright that permant golden marks are left scattered across all of his equipment near the creature. 

The creature lets out a final whimper and slowly falls back to sleep. Dallas - looks at the mark again, as its sparkles and then fades. 

Outside the hum begins again, reverbating the kitchen. 

EXT. DALLAS BACKYARD - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas runs outside with his audio recording equipment in his hand. The hum is growing into a faint roar from the distant marsh. 

As he begins to record - the hum ceases - and he notices that the creature inside is crying loudly. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

Dallas approaches it - and notices that the creature, though still seemingly asleep.


INT. DALLAS DESK - NIGHT

Dallas is peered over his computer and begins to look at the recordings of the day. The heavy receiver sits on the kitchen table, wired to his laptop. Fresh 9-volts in the pack—he's finally got the rig running at full gain.

Dallas as he is reading on computer - is holding a little sringe of chemicals that he hopes will replinish the creature. 

He listens. At first, nothing but the usual low-grade rumble of the marsh. Then—a pulse. Too low for the room mics, but the new batteries are pulling it in. Something layered, almost rhythmic.

Dallas plays a recording of Sierra's voice to soothe the creature only to hear her voice dissolve into the creature's ongoing frequency. 

He replays the clip. Jots a time code. Plays it again. His hand moves to the margin of his notebook: numbers, angles. 

He stares at the scribbles. Grid coordinates. Bearings. The same language Mr. Mike was scratching into the wood.

His elbow brushes the stack of Sierra's folders. One slides open—a corner of a sketch visible. Something with wings. He pushes it closed without looking. 

As he is listening another burst hits the ongoing recording. Dallas looks up from his desk and peers outside. Another faint glow. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN
Dallas makes his way to the creature. 

Dallas looks at the creature - who is appearing to be drinking water and eating the grass - but is still sleeping inside of a gnarl of the aquarium Dallas has obviously made for it. 


INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. The storm is brewing, but the movement in the grass is wrong.

Dallas goes to look at the creature in his makeshift box. It is breathing. Dallas begins to examine all of the blood - it seems to have darkened. 

He touches the photo of his late wife on the side of the receiver. The contact is long.

The hum begins again, lower this time. His equipment remains silent, unable to register the frequency, but the windows of the house begin to rattle in their frames. <!-- [ADDITION] Interior light drain — the creature is pulling current from the house -->
The overhead light dims—not a flicker, but a slow, steady drain, as if something is pulling the current out of the walls. Then it returns to full brightness.
<!-- [/ADDITION] -->

A doorbell is heard off screen breaking Dallas out of his trance.

INT. DALLAS' HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

Dallas opens the door to find Asher and Makayla.

DOMINIC
Thank you for watching Howie - how did he do? 

DALLAS
Good

(action)
Asher looks behind Dallas at all of the equipment. Dallas hands Howie over to Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Okay - we'll - we'll be on our way. Hey - are you still okay with hosting lifegroup on Thursday

Dallas
Yeah. 

DOMINIC
Okay... Hey - everything okay?

DALLAS
Yeah - sorry - I'm just a little tired. 

DOMINIC
Alright well rest well big guy. 

(action)
Asher and Dominic and Howie leave and walk into the next side door. Dallas watches them - and then watches the tall grass sway in the wind. 

Dallas rushes to the kitchen and finds that the creature is doing good.
