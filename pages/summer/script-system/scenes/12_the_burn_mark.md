EXT. DALLAS BACKYARD - TALL GRASS - NEXT MORNING

Makayla approaches with Howie on her bike.

Makayla stares at Dallas for a good while - trying to read his eyes. 

MAKAYLA
I think we shoud talk.

DALLAS
Okay.

MAKAYLA
Have you seen something?... In that tall grass?

DALLAS
No.

MAKAYLA
Really? .. 

(action)
Dallas looks a bit defeated. 

MAKAYLA
I want to see it. 

INT. DALLAS KITCHEN

Dallas and Makayla hover around the table

MAKAYLA
What is it?

DALLAS
I am not sure.

MAKAYLA
How long has it been here for

DALLAS
Around 2 hours.

MAKAYLA
You should keep it here - and we should bring it back tonight.
