INT. DALLAS BEDROOM NIGHT

Dallas can't sleep. His receivers start to beep off. He walks outside.

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE
Dallas finds the courage to walk outside and goes into the tall grass. There he sees a faint glow - as he approaches he notices that there is a group of creatures huddling around the gnarl of an old tree. The creature is biolumenist - much like a firefly - the other creatures scatter into the marsh as if they were little orbs of golden light - but remains is one, smaller than the rest, injured and letting a cry out. 

As it cries out - Dallas' equipment begins to pulse and spike.
