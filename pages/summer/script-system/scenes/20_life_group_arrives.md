INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - EVENING

Dallas brings the creature inside. The outdoor porch oscilloscope—still wired from earlier—begins to pulse, almost in sync with the creature's heartbeat.

The creature begins to fade. Dallas turns the dial to a normal frequency. The creature settles. Sleeps.

HOWIE stays in the corner by the door, disturbed, waiting for his owner. Dallas tries to hide the creature. The moment it cries, the world outside echoes. The ugly hum answers from somewhere far away. The hum floods the town. Windows rattle.

Dallas adjusts the dial again. The creature quiets.

EXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

DOMINIC's car pulls up. He gets out alone—no Janice—arms full of haphazard Costco boxes. He heads for the house.

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

Dominic comes through the door. He sets the boxes down.

DOMINIC
Thanks again for letting the life group meet tonight. Really. You okay?

MR. MIKE walks in behind him. He takes one look at the room and freaks out—like a dog afraid of thunder. He points at the basement door.

MR. MIKE
What is here? What is going on downstairs?!

Dominic steps between Mr. Mike and the stairs. He guides him back by the elbow.

DOMINIC
Easy. Easy. Nothing. Just—

MAKAYLA walks in. She spots the creature. Without a word, without fear, she goes to it and tends to its wound. The creature's glow begins to brighten under her touch.

ASHER joins the huddle. Dominic turns.

DOMINIC
Everybody—calm down. Just—

He sees the creature. He goes still. Then he pushes everyone out of the way and stares.

DOMINIC
What is that?
