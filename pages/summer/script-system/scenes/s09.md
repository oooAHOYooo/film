# Scene 9: The Injured One
<!-- summary:  -->

EXT. INSIDE THE TALL MARSH - SUNSET HOUR

Dallas stands slowly, scanning the reeds around him. Nothing. Just the gentle sway of grass and the sound of his own breathing.

Dallas steps deeper, following the fading glow. 

All around him is light reeeds blowing in an almost whirlwind of light and color. 

Shadows—tall, spindly, and darker than the night—grow in the distance. They move *against* the wind, cutting through the blades of grass like silent ships. Dallas dismisses them as optical illusions. 

As Dallas' eyes adjust to this new brightness - the world around him slowly fades back to normally. 

There in the distance Dallas sees a gnarl tree that looks a little different than the rest of the trees. 

Dallas approaches the tree and in the bottom of it - lives a small birdlike creature - gently bioluminest - and clearly injured. 

Dallas looks at his equipment and it seems to do funny things when he is near it. Dallas gently wraps the creature in his jacket.
