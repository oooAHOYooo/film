# Scene 9: The Injured One
<!-- summary:  -->

EXT. INSIDE THE TALL MARSH - SUNSET HOUR

Dallas stands slowly, scanning the reeds around him. Nothing. Just the gentle sway of grass and the sound of his own breathing.

Dallas pushes through a dense curtain of reeds. Dust motes dance in a whirlwind of color refracting the sunset into jagged prisms on his face. 

Dallas steps deeper, following the fading glow. 

All around him is light reeeds blowing in an almost whirlwind of light and color. 

As Dallas' eyes adjust to this new brightness - the world around him slowly fades back to normally. 

There in the distance Dallas sees a gnarled tree that looks a little different than the rest of the trees. 

Dallas approaches the tree and in the bottom of it - lives a small birdlike creature - gently bioluminest - and clearly injured. 

The creature is small. Birdlike, but not a bird - more round. A cloudlike - cottonball, powder-puff. Small round It skin is fluffy pulsing with a soft glow. Round. Covered in dense, dirty white fur like a dandelion seed head. It looks like a small owl. Its large eyes are closed. With no visible mouth, it looks a bit like a living cotton ball with shivering, transulent ears. 

The 

Dallas reaches out. His hand trembles. He touches the creature's back. The creature flinches but doesn't move away. 

Dallas looks at his equipment and it seems to do funny things when he is near it. 

Suddenly, the wind returns. A violent gust. Shadows in the distance start to fill the sky and hover over Dallas and the creature. Dallas in a daze, slowly grabs the creature and gently places it in his jacket and begins to walk out without looking back.
