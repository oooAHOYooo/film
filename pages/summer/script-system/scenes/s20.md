EXT. BASEMENT

THe creature escapes! 

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - EVENING (CONTINUOUS)

Dominic is flabbergasted. He sits. The crew huddle around the kitchen table. No one speaks. Dominic gets up and locks the front door without looking at it.



Dominic can't take the quiet. He starts to argue.

DOMINIC
Could be some kind of bird. From the ground. Something that nests in the marsh.

MR. MIKE
You're all wrong.

MAKAYLA
We should put it back where we found it. We can't have it in the house. They'll come for it.

DOMINIC
Whose they?

MR. MIKE
We need to leave now. They're coming for it. It's not safe here.

DOMINIC
Can we all pump the breaks on the racoon creature you found. We should get that out of the house - we have life group people coming over. 

Dominic stands. The crew scramble—they have to move the creature before anyone else arrives. They head for the basement.

The doorbell chimes.

INT. DALLAS'S HALL - MOMENTS LATER

The first family for the life group: a young couple—JOSH and SARAH—with their newborn, JP. They introduce themselves to Dallas. He acts off. Distant. Dominic paces in the kitchen. Mr. Mike mutters in his chair, staring at the weather through the window. It's getting worse.

MR. MIKE
(to himself)
This is all a farce. They should be out there. Return it.

Josh and Sarah know to ignore him. They smile, make small talk. Mr. Mike keeps muttering, almost in frustration.

MR. MIKE
One-one-five point two. Hertz. Hertz.

MAKAYLA 
We 

Dallas glances at the basement door. Downstairs, the creature is hidden. For now.
