THe creature escapes! 

Dallas looks for it and so does Makayla. Asher goes upstairs. 

INT. LIVING ROOM

Dallas walks in - and the crowd look at him.

DALLAS
Hey

(action)
Various people lift their hand up in small waves.

TYLER
Dallas - the host of the night - what in the world have you been up to?

DALLAS
Sorry - I was just not feeling well so I was laying down a bit downstairs. 

TYLER
Won't you join us. 

(action)
Makayla joins Dallas in the living room.


Dominic stands. The crew scramble—they have to move the creature before anyone else arrives. They head for the basement.
