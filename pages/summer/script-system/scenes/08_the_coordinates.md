INT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The house smells like old wood and floor wax. Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall.

Dallas stops. On the wall is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.

DOMINIC

My wife and kid. They're... gone now.

Dominic looks toward the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged fingernail.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)

I take care of him. He’s had a rough go since the weather changed.

Dominic moves to the window and shuts the blinds halfway, like he’s done it a thousand times.

Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a gnarled finger at the window.

MR. MIKE

She's here.

Dominic is already moving—trying to calm him, trying to stop him.

Mr. Mike scratches faster. Dallas leans in and catches the numbers before Dominic blocks his view.

MR. MIKE (CONT'D)

Forty-five left. Fifteen right.

Dallas freezes. Dominic flips the end table over—the scratchpad numbers disappear against the floorboards.
