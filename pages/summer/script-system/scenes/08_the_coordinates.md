INT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The house smells like old wood and floor wax. Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall.

Dallas stops. On the wall is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.

DOMINIC

My wife and kid. They're... gone now.

Dominic looks toward the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged fingernail.

DOMINIC (CONT'D)

I take care of him. He’s had a rough go since the weather changed.

Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a gnarled finger at the window.

MR. MIKE

[TODO: Mr. Mike dialogue]
