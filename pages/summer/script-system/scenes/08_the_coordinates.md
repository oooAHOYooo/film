INT. DOMINIC'S BASEMENT 
Dallas and Dominic move an AC unit - as they go to install it - Dallas notices a strange burn mark on the ground near the tall grass. 

He walks over to it and examines it - he brings out his oscillator and then begins to record it a bit. The readings are off.

INT. DOMINIC'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

The house smells like old wood and floor wax. Dallas helps Dominic shove a heavy oak table against the wall.

As they move - Dominic knocks over a photo frame - and Dallas grabs it. On the ground is a small, framed photo of a woman and a young boy.

DOMINIC
My wife and kid... Both gone now. 

(action)
Dallas sheepisly looks at Dominic.

DOMINIC
What about you?

DALLAS
What do you mean?

DOMINIC
Have you have someone that you've lost?

DALLAS
No.


(action)
Dominic looks toward the corner. MR. MIKE (70s) sits in a rocking chair, staring fixedly at the floor. He is scratching something into the wood of the end table with a jagged fingernail.

DOMINIC 
Mr. Mike. I take care of him now. He's had a rough go since the weather changed... He doesn't like it at all. 

(action)
Dominic moves to the window and shuts the blinds halfway, like he's done it a thousand times. Mr. Mike suddenly looks up, his eyes milky but sharp. He points a gnarled finger at the window.

MR. MIKE
She's here! Hey Dominic! Look - she's here

(action)
Dominic dashes across the room to see what is going on - and then, once realizes - dashes for the door.  

Mr. Mike scratches faster. Dallas leans in and catches the numbers before Dominic blocks his view.

MR. MIKE 
Forty-five left. Fifteen right.

Dallas freezes. Dominic flips the end table over—the scratchpad numbers disappear against the floorboards.

MR. MIKE
Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Yes Mr. Mike

MR.MIKE
Your sister is here!

INT. DOMINIC'S KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON

The front door slams open. JANICE (40s) marches in, balancing two bags of groceries and a set of keys between her teeth. Behind her, ASHER (15) and MAKAYLA (22) trudge in, staring at their phones.

JANICE
(spitting out keys)
The traffic on I-95 is a literal nightmare. Dominic, why aren't you cooking the sprouts already? We need to boil them first and then sear them. Last time you just boiled them and it was a disgusting mush... Hi Dallas. 

DOMINIC
You got it Janice. Anything for the brussels.  

JANICE
Okay.

(action)

Janice begins a frantic search for her keys, which she just put down. She stumbles over Dallas's heavy receiver on the floor.

JANICE 
What is this? A boat anchor?

DALLAS
It's a receiver. For work.

INT. DOMINIC'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

Makayla stops by Dallas's equipment. She doesn't look at it with Janice's annoyance; she looks with genuine curiosity.

MAKAYLA
Have you given any thought to what I asked you the other day?

(action)
Dallas looks at Makayla and back at Asher

MAKAYLA
Let my brother borrow it. 

(action)
Asher walks over to Mr. Mike to see how he is doing. Makayla approaches Dallas even further. 

MAKAYLA
Does it pick up frequencies below the human range? I heard something last night. Like a vibrating lung.

(action)
Asher, meanwhile, stands by the window. He ignores the conversation, his eyes fixed on the distant bushes at the edge of the property. The leaves ripple, though there is no wind.

DOMINIC
(yelling from the door)
Everyone in the car! We're going to be late! Dallas, thanks for watching Howie!

The family vanishes in a blur of activity, leaving Dallas standing in the sudden, ringing silence with HOWIE, the small dog.
