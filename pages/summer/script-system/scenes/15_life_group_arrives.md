INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - EVENING

Dominic returns with arms full of Costco boxes. He’s followed by Mr. Mike, who is already muttering and pointing at the basement door.

MR. MIKE

It’s down there! Under the floor! They’re coming for it!

Dominic ignores him, greeting the first family to arrive: JOSH and SARAH, holding their newborn, JP.

DOMINIC

Dallas! You okay? You look like you’ve seen a ghost.

DALLAS

(distracted)

Just... the weather.

Makayla slips past them, her eyes catching Dallas’s. She knows.
