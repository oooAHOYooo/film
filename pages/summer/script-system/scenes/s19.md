INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN / LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

Families arrive in waves. The small kitchen and smaller living room fill. The crowd tries Dominic's toasted Brussels sprouts, passed around on paper plates.

Makayla drifts through the kitchen. She opens drawers quietly. Finds sugar cubes meant for coffee. Pockets one without a word.

INT. DALLAS'S KITCHEN - EVENING

Dallas brings the creature inside. 

The creature begins to fade. Dallas gently places it in the makeshift bed he created the dial to a normal frequency. The creature settles. Sleeps.

HOWIE stays in the corner by the door, disturbed, waiting for his owner. Dallas tries to hide the creature. The moment it cries, the world outside echoes. The ugly hum answers from somewhere far away. The hum floods the town. Windows rattle. 

INT. DALLAS LIVING ROOM

INT. DALLAS'S HALL - MOMENTS LATER

The first family for the life group: a young couple—JOSH and SARAH—with their newborn, JP. They introduce themselves to Dallas. He acts off. Distant. Dominic paces in the kitchen. Mr. Mike mutters in his chair, staring at the weather through the window. It's getting worse.

MR. MIKE
(to himself)
This is all a farce. They should be out there. Return it.

Josh and Sarah know to ignore him. They smile, make small talk. Mr. Mike keeps muttering, almost in frustration.

MR. MIKE
One-one-five point two. Hertz. Hertz.

MAKAYLA 
We have brownies about to be ready.

JOSH
Makayla, how's your mom doing?

MAKAYLA
She's doing better thanks.

JOSH
Dominic, where's the host.

DOMINIC
He's downstairs in the basement - not feeling so good.

SARAH
He knows we're here.

DOMINIC
Yeah - he should be up in a second.

MAKAYLA
I'll go and check on him.

INT. BASEMENT - CONTIOUS

Dallas glances at the basement door. Downstairs, the creature is not doing so good - but seems to be glowing - and the distant hum perks up again. 

INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTIOUS

TYLER
Alright crew, how is everyone's weeks going.

(action)
The group in a circle all look at eacother. 


INT. DALLAS' BASEMENT - CONTINOUS

(action)
The creature lays out a little whipmer. 

Dallas adjusts the dial again. The creature quiets. The lights stabilize.

MR. MIKE walks in behind him. He takes one look at the room and freaks out—like a dog afraid of thunder. He points at the basement door.

MR. MIKE
What is here? What is going on downstairs?!

Dominic steps between Mr. Mike and the stairs. He guides him back by the elbow.

DOMINIC
Easy. Easy. Nothing. Just

MR. MIKE
There is something down there. 

DOMINIC
What is going on. Mr. Mike what is wrong?

(action)
Makayla signals to Asher who drops a plate on purpose.  

DOMINIC
What in the world?!

(action)
Dominic rushes over to the kitchen and sees that the brownies tray is smashed on the ground.
