EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The creature’s pulse is slowing. The glow in its neck dims.

Dallas reaches out, his fingers trembling. As he touches the creature's back, the vibration softens. The creature quiets, its breathing lining up with the hum of his equipment.

He notices the creature was lying on a second crystal, similar to the one Makayla found.

As Dallas lifts the fragile thing toward his chest, it looks out and cries for the crystal—in vain. It faints. The scope in his pocket goes silent.

Suddenly, the wind changes. A heavy, crushing sound approaches through the reeds—something massive, rocketing through the blades like an arrow. Dallas grabs the creature into his coat and rushes out. Howie does not like this.
