EXT. TALL GRASS - MOMENTS LATER

Dallas leaves with the creature 
Dallas finds the creature. 


In a shallow hollow, a cluster of bioluminescent creatures huddle around the gnarl of an old tree—little orbs of gold, pulsing like lanterns.

As Dallas approaches, the lights scatter into the reeds.

One remains. Smaller than the rest. Injured. It lets out a thin cry that makes the scope needle jump.

Dallas looks around. All at once the marsh is silent. The silence comes in waves—pressing, releasing.

He scoops the injured creature into his hands.

The air changes.

A heavy, crushing sound slices through the reeds—something massive rocketing toward him like an arrow.

DALLAS
(to himself)
Go, go, go.

Dallas breaks into a sprint. He reaches the stunted cedar tree—HOWIE is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass.

Dallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is far behind them.

At the edge of his driveway, he finally stops—gasping. The creature is motionless in his coat, but its neck glow pulses weak, fading amber.
