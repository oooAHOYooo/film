# Scene 10: The Chase
<!-- nickname: Creature discovery -->

EXT. TALL GRASS - MOMENTS LATER

The air changes.

A heavy, crushing sound slices through the reeds—something massive rocketing toward him like an arrow.

Dallas breaks into a sprint. He reaches the stunted cedar tree—HOWIE is a blur of panic, barking at the wall of grass.

Dallas grabs the leash and doesn't stop running until the marsh is far behind them.

At the edge of his driveway, he finally stops—gasping. The creature is motionless in his coat, but its neck glow pulses weak, fading amber.
