EXT. MARSH TRAIL - DAY

Dallas walks the coastal trail with Howie. Suddenly, the air vibrates. A roar-hum hybrid sound erupts from the reeds.

Dallas and Howie step onto the narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh. 

As they walk - the air changes into damp, metallic, stillness.

EXT. MARSH ENTRANCE

Dallas and Howie stop at the creek's edge and pan glances towards the outer marsh.

Howie's ears perk and he begins to gently whine, pressing against Dallas's leg. In the distance, a flicker of golden light pulses deep within the marsh. 

Dallas crouches and lifts him, holding Howie a moment longer than necessary as he catches his breath. Howie's breathing begins to quicken. Dallas steadies him, resting his forehead briefly against Howie as he steadies him. 

From the distance a light flickers deep in the marsh. Dallas notices it - but it is gone. 

Dallas lowers Howie to the ground and his equipment begins to beep. 

Dallas flips open his handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern. 

Dallas clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy. He is drawn to it, his movements rhythmic and dazed.

His handheld scope chirps. The waveform is no longer random; it's a repeating, melodic pattern.

He ties Howie's leash to a stunted cedar tree and steps off the path, disappearing into the golden-yellow reeds.

EXT. TALL GRASS HOLLOW - CONTINUOUS

The reeds are so high they block the sun. Dallas pushes through to a small clearing—a shrunken tree hollow surrounded by dead leaves. 

A cry rings out. It's not a throat-sound; it's air being forced through something hollow.

Dallas kneels. Inside the pile of leaves, something is moving. He clears the debris to reveal a small, birdlike creature covered in downy fur with long, rabbit-like ears.

A flickering glow emanates from its neck. Its "back-holes"—delicate vents along its spine—vibrate as it breathes, creating the sound that syncs perfectly with Dallas's receiver.
