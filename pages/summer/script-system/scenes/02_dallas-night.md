INT. DALLAS NEW HOUSE - NIGHT

Dallas struggles to fall asleep in his new home. He hears strange noises from outside. As he looks out the window he sees a flicker of a faint gold light. 

Curious and wide awake - Dallas finishes unpacking boxes. The room is sparse, filled with moving supplies and a few pieces of furniture.

He hears a noise from outside. Dallas pauses and peers outside. Curious, he opens a box marked "GENIVE."

Dallas pulls out a heavy, a bunch of old vanilla folders. military-grade desktop Oscillator, a portable audio recorder, an a portable Oscillator. In the bottom of the box, covered in dust, sumberged by cables,  Dallas finds and old pair of retro red headphones. 

On one of the headphones, Dallas peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker.

The photo shows Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass.

Dallas's thumb rushes over her face. He holds the contact for a beat too long.

Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver.

As he does this, he hears a HUM emerging from outside.

Dallas walks to the window and attempts to record the readings, and just as it capturing something, the battery dies.  

He sets the receiver down and heads for the door.
