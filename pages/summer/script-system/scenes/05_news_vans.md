EXT. BRANFORD NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

Dallas and Dominic reach back to their neighborhood. Outside, nestled between their house, three news vans are parked haphazardly.

This afternoon we'll see sun to clouds, breezy and warm with a late day shower possible. But the real attention - and as why we are here - is to bring attention to a possible development along the shores of Eastern Connecticut - at the heart of the Branford should receive the most impact. We are watching the trend through the rest of this week - as any shift could dramatically impact the entire state. The computer models are showing better agreement. 
...and while we're all hoping the Nor'easter stays out at sea, the current models suggest a wild weekend for the shoreline. Hopefully, it holds off until after Sunday's festival, but folks, get those generators ready!

Dominic scoffs as they walk past.

Dallas notices that there is some red eyes lurking in the windsill reflections. 

The wind gusts, catching a news umbrella and nearly toppling it. The hum in Dallas's pocket receiver spikes for a split second.
