EXT. CHURCH FELLOWSHIP LAWN - LATE AFTERNOON

Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in heat of a picnic. Children are running, friends in light summerwear play spike ball, and people are on line getting food. Dallas looks around at all of the new faces but does not make eye contact. Dominic takes a deep breath, also appearing a little nervous. 

Dominic carries a package of water and puts it under one of the fold up tables. 

DOMINIC
Alright buddy - let's wait on line I guess. 

(action)
Dominic and Dallas wait on line to be served at fellowship lunch. 

Janice, Mid 50s, puts her hand on Dominic's shoulder.

DOMINIC
Sister.

JANICE
Brother.

DOMINIC
This is Dallas.

DALLAS
Hello.

JANICE
Hey Dallas. Dominic did you get the car?

(action)
MAKAYLA, 22, and ASHER, 15 - emerge behind Janice. 

DOMINIC
(ignoring Janice)
Dallas, these are my niece and nephew - Makayla and Asher.

(action)
Makayla and Asher don't say much but wait online. Makayla taps Asher on the shoulder and nods towards a far end of the church lawn. Between the bushes and garden. 

The two leave the line for food and walk over to it. Dallas watches.

JANICE
So what happened Dominic. 

DOMINIC
Yeah - and it had a ticket.

JANICE
How much. 

DOMINIC
A good amount. 

JANICE
That's great. 

Janice leaves the line of food.

Dallas takes a plate but doesn't eat much. He's distracted, listening.

DOMINIC
So, what are you here for?

DALLAS
Work.

DOMINIC
At Yale?

DALLAS
Quinnipiac. Starting next semester. Got a couple months to get settled.

DOMINIC
What kind of work?

DALLAS
Bioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh—birds, insects, coyotes. I start next semester.

DOMINIC
Nice. So are you here alone?

DALLAS
Yep.

DOMINIC

Okay cool. That's cool.

They finish eating. The group begins to disperse.

DOMINIC

Want to walk back together? I'll show you around.

DALLAS

Sure.

(action)

They start walking towards the marsh, towards the New England coast.

In the far distance, COYOTES HOWL.
