EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

The Life Group has departed, leaving the house in a hollow silence. Dallas stands by the tall window, staring into the dark.

He looks at his monitor—a grainy video feed of the creature in the basement. It’s breathing, but the frequency of the room is shifting.

Dallas looks out toward the tall grass. A pair of bright, dim-red eyes emerge in the distance. He blinks, looking at the telephone pole—a red light. A car in the distance—a red light.

He returns his gaze to the grass. The red eyes are gone. Then, they reappear, swirling through the blades, inching closer to the house. Pulses of red light flicker like a predatory heartbeat.
