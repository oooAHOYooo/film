INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - HALL / DEN - NIGHT

The Life Group has departed. Candle shadows dance across the hall. Dallas, wide awake, checks a small video feed of the creature in the den downstairs—temperature, frequency of the earth, the hum of the box. 

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT (same)

Dallas looks out the tall window toward the marsh. In the distance, a pair of bright, dim red eyes. He scans the street: the telephone pole has a red light; something down the block glows red. He looks back at the tall grass. The red eyes are gone.

Closer: the eyes reappear, swirling through the blades, watching the house. Little pulses of red light, inch by inch, toward the edge of the yard.

INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - BASEMENT / DEN - NIGHT

Dallas hurries downstairs to check on the creature. The makeshift box is empty. It's gone.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas at the window again. The eyes are gone. The night is still.
