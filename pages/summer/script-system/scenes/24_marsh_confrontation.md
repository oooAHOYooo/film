INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - DAY (NEXT MORNING OR LATER)

Dallas rushes downstairs. HOWIE whimpers at his heels. He reaches the shoebox. It's empty. The window above is unlatched. Swinging in the wind.

EXT. DALLAS'S DRIVEWAY - SAME TIME

JANICE gets out of her car and stops. Her minivan is covered in strange, scorched patterns—burn marks. She pulls out her phone. Takes a photo. Scrapes one mark with her key.

ASHER stands beside her. He follows the trail with his eyes. Burn marks lead from the driveway toward the house—along the siding, up toward the windows. A path. Something left. Something came for the creature.

ASHER
Mom. Look.

JANICE
Dallas! What is happening to my car?

She can't find him. Inside, Dallas is already in the backyard—staring at the marsh with his oscillator. The creature is gone. The bad things are calling it back. The trail of burn marks points the way.
