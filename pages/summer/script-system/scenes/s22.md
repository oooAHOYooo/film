INT. DALLAS'S BASEMENT - NIGHT

The creature sleeps in a makeshift box. Dallas has a heat lamp on it. Machines are haphazardly arranged around it—a mini-hospital. The crowd—Dominic, Makayla, Asher—gather around. The creature, like a little bird, responds to the equipment. Curious. Fragile.

Asher enters the room. Makayla follows. Dallas ignores their presence, focused on the creature. Everyone's eyes widen. The creature wakes up. It goes into an almost frozen state—as if it's operating on a different timeline.

Dallas excuses himself. He needs air.

Makayla gently places the sugar cube near the creature. The creature leans toward it. The sound from its back-holes evens out. Makayla slides the sugar cube two inches farther away. She watches what happens.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - NIGHT

Dallas stands alone. In a trance. He looks out at the tall grass for a long time. He slowly turns a dial on the receiver. The hum shifts. Almost instantly, something moves deep in the grass. Dallas freezes. He returns the dial to the previous setting. The movement stops.

<!-- [ADDITION] Makayla discovers Sierra's folder — scientific legacy pillar -->
INT. DALLAS'S STUDY - SAME TIME

Makayla sits cross-legged on the floor. Around her: a scattered pile of folders, cassettes, and loose pages. A label on the box reads "SIERRA." She opens a manila folder and stops. Inside: hand-drawn sketches—anatomical, careful. Golden creatures with back-holes and translucent ears. Dated 1978.

She flips through. More sketches. Frequency notations. A map of the marsh with circles drawn in red ink. Sierra had documented everything.

Makayla carries the folder outside.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

She holds the open folder in front of Dallas. He stares at the sketches. His wife's handwriting. He can't speak.

MAKAYLA
They've been here since the seventies. Hiding in the noise.

She closes the folder. Holds it against her chest.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
If the Red-Eyes take them out tonight, this folder is just a collection of ghost stories. I'm not letting them become a myth again.

Dallas looks at her. Then back at the grass.
<!-- [/ADDITION] -->

Dominic comes outside.

DOMINIC
Wind's picking up.

Dallas doesn't answer. He's still staring at the grass.

INT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

The room is sparse. Chairs pushed aside. The crew has decided: they'll take it back. Drop it off where they found it.

Dominic, Makayla, and Asher discuss the plan. Dallas stares blankly, half listening. The hum is back. It fills the silence.

They are the last to leave. Dominic herds the kids toward the door. Dallas stays by the window a moment longer. Then he follows. The house empties. The creature remains in the basement—for now.
