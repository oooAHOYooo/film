# Scene 22: Sierra's Folder
<!-- summary: They find it in the gnarl. It's fading. Sierra's folder: if the Red-Eyes take them, it's all ghost stories. They'll return it. -->
EXT. DALLAS PORCH

Makayla, Asher and Dallas stand outside. The hum rises. Asher's hand is in his pocket—on the crystal. He's not drawing. 

MAKAYLA
We should go to the fortress—we got to find a way to see what's going on in there.

ASHER
I don't want to go back, Makayla.

MAKAYLA
That's fair. Dallas we'll go.

(action)
Dominic takes the last package of grocies back into his minivan.



They work in silence—listening, adjusting, mapping the signal. Makayla pulls out Sierra's folder and cross-references a frequency notation with what's on screen. A match.


INT. DALLAS'S STUDY - SAME TIME

Makayla sits cross-legged on the floor. Around her: a scattered pile of folders, cassettes, and loose pages. A label on the box reads "SIERRA." She opens a manila folder and stops. Inside: hand-drawn sketches—anatomical, careful. Golden creatures with back-holes and translucent ears. Dated 1978.

She flips through. More sketches. Frequency notations. A map of the marsh with circles drawn in red ink. Sierra had documented everything.

Makayla carries the folder outside.

EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

She holds the open folder in front of Dallas. He stares at the sketches. His wife's handwriting. He can't speak.

MAKAYLA
They've been here since the seventies. Hiding in the noise.

She closes the folder. Holds it against her chest.

MAKAYLA (CONT'D)
If the Red-Eyes take them out tonight, this folder is just a collection of ghost stories. I'm not letting them become a myth again.

Dallas looks at her. Then back at the grass.
<!-- [/ADDITION] -->

Dominic comes outside.

DOMINIC
Wind's picking up.

Dallas doesn't answer. He's still staring at the grass.

INT. DALLAS'S LIVING ROOM - LATER

The room is sparse. Chairs pushed aside. The crew has decided: they'll take it back. Drop it off where they found it.

Dominic, Makayla, and Asher discuss the plan. Asher has his notebook open—1153, the dial numbers, circled. He doesn't add anything. Just watches. Dallas stares blankly, half listening. The hum is back. It fills the silence.

They are the last to leave. Dominic herds the kids toward the door. Dallas stays by the window a moment longer. Then he follows. The house empties. The creature remains in the basement—for now.
