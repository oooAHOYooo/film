EXT. MAKAYLA'S LAIR

Makayla and Dallas and Asher begin to make there way hastly out of the woods. They are in a rush to go back to Dallas' house to return the creature. 

As they do - they see that dark figures are haunting them - but from a distance. 

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE

(action)
In the middle of the yard is a jagged, blackened circle—a burn mark in the grass. At its center lies a small, translucent crystal.

Makayla kneels and touches it. Her hair begins to flutter, static electricity pulling the strands toward the stone. 

Dominic pulls up with Janice and a minivan full of things from Costco

She quickly pockets it as Dominic yells from the car.

Makayla turns to Dallas and looks at Asher. He nods. 

MAKAYLA
Dallas, Uncle Dominic can't know about this. No one can. Not until we get more evidence. He'll freak out and make us take it back.

Dallas makes his way to the kitchen and begins to bring the makeshift hospital down to the basement. 

INT. DALLAS BASEMENT

Dallas sets up the creature - but as he does he nearly drops the box. He looks at his arm a burn mark.
