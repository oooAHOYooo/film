EXT. MAKAYLA'S LAIR

Makayla and Dallas and Asher begin to make there way hastly out of the woods. They are in a rush to go back to Dallas'.

As they do - they see that dark figures are haunting them - but from a distance. 

MAKAYLA
Asher, what did you see?

ASHER
Not much - I don't really remember.

MAKAYLA
What don't you remember?

ASHER
I don't know. 

MAKAYLA
The creature just gave you a direct communication from an intelligence outside of humanity and you can't tell me what they said or told you? 

ASHER
I guess not. 

(action)
Makayla huffs and walks faster. She circles around the wigwam and looks back at Asher.

MAKAYLA
I'm sorry little brother. 

EXT. DALLAS HOUSE

The crew walk back to Dallas's house. Makayla and Asher walk up to the front door and take Howie who was inside this time. Dominic pulls up and honks the horn.

JANICE
(leaning out the window)
You kids! I said the basement was off limits tonight so you're in Dallas basement now.

MAKAYLA
Dallas, Uncle Dominic can't know about this. No one can. Not until we get more evidence. He'll freak out and make us take it back.

(action)
Dallas looks onward and waves. 

DOMINIC
(out the window)
Dallas, you ready.
