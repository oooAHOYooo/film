EXT. EDGE OF TALL GRASS - DAY

The crew watches from a distance. In the marsh: a battle of pulse and shadow. The red-eyed creatures surround the small ones. They devour them. A mirage of flickering yellow lights against the red. Then it all stops.

The bad creatures turn. They seek the humans.

They 
(action)
Asher has another panic attack on the floor - his eyes and mouth open again out in the cold marsh. 

ASHER
Run.

DALLAS grabs ASsher 

They run out of the tall grass and don't stop until they're home.

EXT. / INT. DALLAS'S HOUSE - LATER

MAKAYLA AND DALLAS are out of breath. Makayla lifts up her arm and there are burn marks. She begins freaking out. 


EXT. DALLAS'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS

Dallas drags his equipment to the edge of the yard—the oscillator, the military receiver, two speakers he's wired in series. He positions them facing the marsh, angled toward each other, creating a narrow corridor between them. He checks the meter. Adjusts. Checks again.

MAKAYLA watches. She walks over. She pulls Sierra's folder from her jacket. Points to a sketch—a waveform diagram with two opposing frequencies colliding.


Dallas studies her face. Then he adjusts the second speaker, widening the corridor by a foot. Makayla attaches a sensor between the speakers and wires it to Dallas's receiver. The trap is acoustic—invisible. No wall. Just two frequencies waiting to collide.

ASHER gives Dominic a tour of the equipment. Asher reaches for the dial, then pulls his hand back when it squeals.

The storm rolls in. Makayla runs toward JANICE. Mr. Mike, Asher, and Dominic are outside. Dallas looks stunned, staring into the tall grass. Dominic, without a word, begins to help him position the equipment.

Dallas examines the trap. A small radio plays—PAT CLENDENEN from the news van, welcoming Branford to a beautiful southern New England morning. The contrast is cruel.

The crew stare at the tall grass. The trap is set—not a wall to hide behind, but a kill zone designed to catch a predator. Soon: the crawl of fire engines in the distance. Sea birds. And then the hum.

Dallas walks back to the house. The crew follows. They wait on the porch. The storm is here.

DOMINIC
This is crazy. What are we doing here.

No one answers.
