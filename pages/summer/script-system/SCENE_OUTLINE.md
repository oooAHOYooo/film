# Creatures in the Tall Grass — Scene Outline

Use this to stay on track while writing. Scene numbers and file names match the script system.

**Drafting note:** Scene files are intentionally numbered (`s01.md`, `s02.md`, …) so you can freely change scene names later without renaming files. Stable “nicknames” live in `manifest.json` as `nickname` (currently identical to `id`).
