## ACT I — Arrival & Discovery ~20 minutes

**Scene 01**

	Dallas moves to town. As he finishes unpacking – he hears a noise from the great marsh outside his new house – he pauses, and pulls up dusty equipment from a moving box. Dallas pulls out a heavy, military grade Oscillator device –  covered in dust – he peels back a piece of tape to reveal a photo  of himself with a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laughing in a field of grass. Dallas' thumb rushes over her face – and holds the contact for a beat too long. As Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver - he hears a faint hum emerging in the distance. Dallas steps outside and begins recording. He stands on the back steps, aiming the receiver toward the field beyond the last line of trees. The display spikes – then abruptly goes dead. Dallas walks into town for batteries – and on the way – he meets his neighbor Dominic – who follows him on his journey. On the way, Dominic convinces Dallas to come to a fellowship lunch at his church. They go.

**Scene 02**

	As they venture towards the church – Dominic discovers a parking ticket on his car and gets a little testy. While Dominic wonders where all of the ticket money is going, in light with all of the raccoon problems and other trash problems. Dallas notices that one of his equipments compass is facing the direction towards the marsh*. 

**Scene 03**

	Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in a circle with other church goers eating Sally's outside as they picnic among the late summer breeze.  After, Dallas and Dominic walk home and as they do so, they walk towards the marsh – and the wind – and the New England coast – and as they walk, coyotes howl in the far distance – "What are you here for" asks Dominic – "Work" answers Dallas "At Yale?" "Quinnipiac" – What kind of work? ""Bioacoustics. I was hired to record the marsh – birds, insects, and coyotes. I start next semester. "'Nice - are you here alone?" – "Yeah" - "Okay cool - that's cool" replies Dominic. "Me too" 

**Scene 04 · 05 · 06**

	The two get lost around Branford for a bit – wandering through different sidewalks, neighborhoods, marsh lands and tall grass. Dominic listens to the quiet and the breeze area – and explains to Dallas all of the different type of coastal birds and his thoughts on the different sounds Dallas might want to record  – and the how he has an app that the phone could tell the species. Dallas takes observant note of the noise the distance produces. Dallas catalogs it. As they continue – they witness a bunch of news vans huddled outside of the nearby town center. News specialist Pat Clendenen – bangs on about the Nor'easter – and prepares folks for wild set of upcoming weather – hopefully that doesn't interfere with this weekend's summer harvest festival.

**Scene 07 · 08**

	As they approach their neighborhood  – Dominic becomes upset again – as he notices that the trash cans are dumped over the side of the house. Dominic invites Dallas over to help him clean a mess that the kids made while they were over – mainly just furniture needs to be rearranged – and while they are exiting Dominic's house moving – Dallas notices a painting of someone who is no longer around – Dallas looks for a moment and gets a moment of looks and meets eyes with Mr. Mike – who is in the corner yelling. Dominic walks over – "Yeah yeah – that was my wife – and my child" "I take care of him now," gesturing at Mr Mike. Dominic asks if Dallas had someone special in his life "Yes, but not anymore" – they look at each other – "Yeah – it has been tough – how you holding up?" Asks Dominic "Alright – how are you holding up? Alright" replies Dallas. Mr Mike peers out the window and begins to become flustered at the weather. Dominic shuts the blinds halfway without asking. "She's here" – Mr Mike yells "She's here". Dominic goes for the door. Dallas notices that Mr Mike isn't just yelling – he is scratching gibberish symbols at the wooden end table. Dominic seeing this rushes over to stop him. Dominic flips the table over so the scratchpad numbers disappear. 

**Scene 09 · 10**

	Like a bull through a china shop, Dominics sister Janice arrives with her kids, teasing Dallas into Dog sitting her dog Howie – Dallas agrees. Janice walks over to discover that Dominic is cooking the brussel sprouts incorrectly – and the gravy is a mess. An argument erupts. All of a sudden – Janice starts to look for her keys in a frantic way – stumbling upon Dallas' equipment – which the her daughter Makayla, 22, – walks towards and peppers questions about the equipment. Her little brother Asher, 15, peers at the distant bushes after greeting Mr. Mike haphazardly. Dominic ushers everyone to get into the car – they are going to be late – the crew in a whirlwind of activity, leave Dallas alone with the dog Howie.

**Scene 11 · 12**

	As Dallas walks home with the dog Howie, The Long Island Sound roars against the Branford rocks, and Dallas notices that his portable reader spikes violently near the distant field near the tall grass. Dallas starts to tune and record the frequencies around him – but it is no use. Distant dogs bark in the distance – followed by even further away coyotes – and the storm alerts pop up. Everything goes still. The hum begins – and it grows denser and deeper and eventually everywhere – Dallas checks his surroundings and begins to stare at it in a daze – Howie is afraid which prompts Dallas to move on.

**Scene 13**

	That night, Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. Dominic shows up with Asher to collect Howie and asks if everything is okay – "It is fine" replies Dallas. Later that night, Dallas looks out the window again at the marsh – his equipment ready but they read silent – he touches a photo of his late wife – and then the hum begins. As Dallas looks tall shadows grow in the distance and move against the wind. The distant sounds becomes more distinct – but distant.

## ACT II — The Creature ~ 30 minutes

**Scene 14 · 15**

	Dawn. The storm approaches. Janice drops off her dog Howie with Dallas, before rushing to work at the museum, where she's helping secure artwork before the nor'easter' hits. She thanks Dallas tremendously who, in return, doesn't say much – but begins to have an certain kinship with this little dog Howie. Outside, Makayla and Asher, jump out of the minivan, to run off to look at something in the far distance of Dallas' house - Dallas approaches - it looks like a burn mark - - next to the burn mark is a small rock - crystal – Makayla looks down and touches one of the crystals – and her hair begins to flutter – she quickly grabs it and places it in her pocket – She pulls it back out, puts it on the burn mark and watches her hair stand up. She flinches, then presser her hand flat against the ground. She closes her eyes, waiting, as if the ground might answer. Dominic yells at them to get to the car – but quickly shuts the car after he gets a text that the schools were cancelled due to the impending weather. Dominic emerges from the mini-van to help the kids back in – and runs over to greet Howie – and asks Dallas if he needs anything from Costco and hands him a bunch of papers for all of the life group tonight – "Thanks for doing this." 

**Scene 16**

	Dallas and Howie step onto the narrow dirt path that runs behind the houses, where lawns thin into reeds and the creek bends toward the marsh. The air changes — damp, metallic, quiet. They stop at the creek's edge. From somewhere beyond the tall grass, the low roar begins — not sudden, but gathering — and the hum folds into it. Howie's ears perk. He presses against Dallas's legs, unsure. Dallas crouches and lifts him, holding him for a moment longer than necessary. Howie's breathing is quick. Dallas steadies him, resting his forehead briefly against the dog's. A light flickers deep in the marsh. Dallas notices it — then nothing else. He lowers Howie to the ground. His equipment begins to beep. Dallas stops. He flips open the handheld scope and watches the waveform settle into an otherworldly pattern. He clicks "Record," then checks the timestamp twice. The trace snaps into a perfect ladder of lines, and Dallas lowers the scope as if it's suddenly heavy. He ties Howie to a nearby tree at the edge of the grass. Howie resists once, then stills, watching. Dallas checks the scope one more time, looks back at Howie, and steps into the tall grass. He doesn't look up again — only at the screen — wiping mud from it with his sleeve as he walks.

**Scene 17**

	As he does – and almost in a daze – Dallas walks toward a shrunken tree hollow – where it almost looks like dozens of eyes surround him through the tall golden-yellow reeds – in that hollow a movement of leaves – and in that movement – a cry of what sounds like an animal. The cry continues – putting Dallas into a daze as he begins to approach it.

**Scene 18**

	As he moves closer he discovers that something is injured inside of it. As he approaches closer and closer – his eye's widen – for in front of him is is a tiny otherworldly creature. Dallas scope chirps softly again – the waveform tightens. The creature breathes heavily – and emits a cry. The reading doesn't spike – it locks into phase, breathing in time with the creature. The creature's breath, doesn't come out of its mouth – but instead appears via delicate holes of its back – as if air is being forced through a living reed – it lets out another cry. The holes flutter in sequence. 

	Dallas bends down to get a closer look. The creature is fragile, birdlike, covered in downy fur, with long rabbit-like ears and a diminishing flickering glow beneath its neck. Dallas – amazed by the creature – stares for a good while at its complexity and beauty – when suddenly – he realizes that its pulse is slowing. Dallas moves closer and touches the back of the creature – as he does – the creature quiets down and its rhymes of its "back-holes" line up perfectly with his equipment readings. 

**Scene 19**

	As Dallas picks up the creature – he notices it that it was lying on top of a crystal. As Dallas pulls the creature up towards his bosom – the creature looks out and cries out for it – but its cries and in-vein and it suddenly faints. The scope blinks silent. In the distance suddenly – Dallas senses an urgent fear – as if something massive is following him in the distance – rocketing closer and closer through the blades like an arrow – Dallas quickly grabs the creature in his coat – and rushes outside. Howie does not like this – and begins to freak out. Dallas, the creature, and Howie – make the long journey back to the house.

**Scene 20**

When Dallas finally arrives – he brings it into his kitchen – and as he does – his outdoor porch oscilloscope begin to pulse dramatically almost insync with the creatures heartbeat – and as the creature begins to fade – Dallas tries to turn the dial into a normal frequency and that seems to put the creature to sleep. Howie – disturbed in the corner – waits by the door for his owner and Dallas – tries to hide the creature – but when it cries – the world outside echoes – and then the ugly hum responds with a source far away. The hum floods the town. Windows rattle.

Dominic returns without Janice – carrying loads of haphazard boxes from Costco – Dominic thanks Dallas again for letting the life group meet tonight at his house. Mr Mike walks in and begins to freak out, like a dog being afriad of thunder – Mr Mike begins to exclaim – what is here and he points to the basement – and asks what is going on downstairs?! Dominic steps between Mr. Mike and the stairs and guides him back by the elbow. Makayla walking behind him spots the creature and, without fear, attends to its wound. Its glow begins to brighten with her touch. Asher joins the huddle – and Dominic yells for everyone to be calm. And then he himself notices the creature and pushes everyone out of the way. 

**Scene 21**

Dominic, flabbergasted sits silently as the crew huddle around the kitchen table. He locks the front door without looking at it. Dallas puts little tiny wires on the creatures head. Dallas notices that when the creature is calm – it emits a low melodic tone – but when Howie begins to bark – the holes change vibrations and emits a sad cry – much like a whimper.  Dominic, impatient on all of the quiet scientific observation begins to argue about types of this could be birds from the ground. Mr. Mike argues that they are all are wrong. Makayla argues that they should put it back where they found it – that they can't have it in the house – and Mr Mike agrees with Makayla and yells that they need to leave now – that they are coming for the creature – and that it is not safe here.

As the crew scramble with the creature downstairs - the door bell upstairs chimes – the first family to join the life group – a young couple with a newborn JP – enter the scene and begin to introduce themselves to Dallas who acts a bit off – Dominic paces in the kitchen – and Mr Mike mutters to himself in the chair – looks at the weather outside getting worse – and utters that this is all a farce – they should be out their and return the creature. But the couple knows to politely ignore Mr Mike – who begins to mutter to himself, almost in frustration – 115.2 degrees – Hertz - Hertz.

**Scene 22**

Families arrive in waves – filling up Dallas' small kitchen and smaller living room. The crowd try the toasted Brussels pre-cooked by Dominic. Makayla drifts through the kitchen – opening drawers quietly. She finds sugar cubes meant for coffee and pockets one without comment. In the basement, Dallas looks at his old equipment while he is shuffling through the pile of mono. For a moment the creature doesn't look like it is doing much – but its breathing slightly – Dallas struggles to find a bed for it – and settles on an old shoe box – he takes one with his wife's equipment puts it aside and gently nestles the small creature into it – as it breathes slowly and its little feet curl tightly. Makayla and Asher watch Dallas sneak down the stairs to get a look– and Dallas finds a way to poke a hole to make it drinkable – Makayla and Asher watch from the staircase. Makayala takes out the crystal and it begins to glow a bit – and her hair begin. And she and the creature begin to communicate. The creature's glow dims as Makayla pulls her hand away. 

**Scene 23**

	People start to ask where Dallas is – and Dominic – leading the lifegroup – lies – and says that they have found a little cat and that Dallas is downstairs nursing it. One lifegroup member stands up and says – well I am a vet – I could go look. Yeah – Dominic – "I mean should we stop the prayer?" – I think that cat is just sleeping – we could check after? An elderly woman agrees. 

	Life group and is asked how Howie is doing – where is Howie – and the leader Josh – one of the young couples – begins to give an opening ice breaker – while Dallas, Dominic and his two kids kind of sit silent. Tyler hands out music sheets for everyone to sing and they do and they do. As the final notes of the hymn breach to a close – the hum begins to start up again – in the distance – it seems that the life group's hymn also increases the People look at each other and make comments – Pat – Branford's weatherman, and newly joined life group member – begins to relish on the weather.

	During a silent time of reflection the time of reflection – the hum begins to start up again – leaving everyone unsettled and asking questions as to what in the world that noise was. The group settles on talk of the weird weather patterns that have been plaguing the Branford community and that what the status of this upcoming storm is. In time – people leave and hug goodbye – as Dominic waves them goodbye – he waits for the last person to leave before he rushes downstairs with the kids to see what the deal is with the creature. 

	The creature sleeps in some makeshift box and Dallas has a heat lamp to it – the crowd gather around it is curious that the creature, like a little bird responds to his machines that he haphazardly arranged around it like a mini-hospital. Asher enters the room – followed by Makayla. Dallas – ignoring their presence and huddle around the makeshift hospital bed –  everybody's eye widen – as the creature wakes up – and goes into an almost frozen state – like it is operating on a different timeline.  Dallas excuses himself – and for some fresh air. Makayla gently places the sugar cube near the creature. The creature leans toward it, the sound evening out. Makayla slides the sugar cube two inches farther away and watches what happens. 

	Outside – Dallas by himself – in an almost trance – looks out into the tall grass for a good while.  Dallas slowly turns a dial on the receiver – the hum shifts – and almost instantly, something moves deep in the grass. Dallas freezes, returns the dial to the preivous setting, and the movement stops. Dominic comes outside to check on him – and says the wind is picking up. "Thats… not wind."

	Back upstairs with the living room sparse and haphazard - the crew decided that it will go and drop it off where they found it. As they discuss this Dallas stares blankly half listening. The hum is back. Dominic, Makayla and Asher are the last to leave and leave. 

**Scene 24 · 25**

	Dallas stares wide awake as the shadows from his candle dance across the hall. He looks at a little video feed he has of the creature in the den downstairs – and the temperature – and the frequenecy of the earth – and then the hum of the box – and then the tape recorder – which he plays – as he goes to bed – it is a song of his late talking about her theories – of the great hum – she read as a girl – and a big narration as to why she had to stop. and looks out the tall window – in the distance – through his backyard - he begins to fixate at a pair of bright dim bright red eyes in the great distance - - Dallas looks across the street – at the other lights around his property – the telephone pole – has a red light – there is something down the street with a red light – and then Dallas returns his gaze upon the tall grass – but poof – the red eyes are gone. as Dallas looks closer the eyes look like they are swirling through the blades of grass watching his house. It looks like little pulses of red lights that go inch by inch closer to the edge. Dallas makes his way downstairs to check on the creature – but it is gone – nervous he looks out and the eys are gone and the night is still.

## ACT III — The Return ~30 minutes

**Scene 26**

	Mr. Mike barges into the house. Makayla chases after him but to no avail – Mr Mike searches haphazardly and yells – "Where is it? Where is it?" Makayla chases behind Mr Mike and makes eye contact with Dallas. Meanwhile, Janice gets out of her car to look at weird burn marks around her minivan – Janice takes a photo, then scrapes one mark with her key. Asher, next to her notices that the trail of burn marks leads to the windows of the house – and then a little burn mark on the side of the house. She can't seem to find Dallas – he is staring at the abyss outside with his oscillator. Dallas moves a pole slightly and checks the read again. Makayla, from a distance, watches Dallas before she walks over and fixes a pole of her own. She adjusts one wire when Dallas' reading jumps. The two begin to make a fence around the house. Dallas looks over and acknowledges her presence. 

	As they dig and plant poles, Makayla asks what happens and Dallas the creature is gone. Makayla grabs Dallas' device off the table, and Dominic grabs her wrist. Together they hear another cry that sounds like a big distant – the creatures – and then that familiar hum. Makayla turns to Dallas – we have to go get it back – the bad creatures want to kill it. Dallas and Makayla begin to walk the trail with Howie – and see the same glow. They rush over – and by and by – as they inch closer to the salt marsh - they find a group of creatures all attending to the injured creature from before.

**Scene 27**

	At first, the creatures scatter about – the younger ones – two or three of them - but the older ones wave their hands and from their backs a mist is sprayed bit – and Makayla and Dallas loose control of their bodies. The creatures hum – cause Dallas and Makayla to walk backwards away. As they do -  more lights appear. Dozens of golden glow rise like lanterns in the distant mist. But these bright lights all around begin to contrast with the red ones also all around. And soon the red eyes confront the golden eyes. 

	The red eyes begin to circle around the bright eyes – and one by one snatch them in a blur – but the mind could imagine of a predatory creature pouncing on the prey. The red-eye creatures do not hum – they cancel, erasing the sound the way shadow erases light. Within a moment, more predators emerge – with their glowing red eyes and for every inch they creep – their shadow goes up the tall grass. The paralysis of Dallas and Makayla – seems to be caused by an elder of the good creatures and their full might – but are no match – they begin to focus on the predators actions.

	The predators eyes blink a bit and causes great fear amount the creatures to huddle around. Dallas and Makayla move slowly away and walk briskly back the way they came – but not before Dallas has one more interaction with - the tiny little creature in the distance – its pulse blinks large – and then diminishes – awful sound of gnashing engulf – and Dallas – caught in the moment – takes out his dial – and it causes the creature to pulse again – and the creatures retract. Dallas quickly grabs the creature and runs out.

As Dallas runs – he stops – and realizes that the creature has stopped pulsing all together – and now is motionless – he puts the creature down – and other pulses gather – hearing the hums gradually getting lower and lower on the bass scale Dallas makes his way out of the tall grass.

**Scene 28**

As the crew watch in the distance they witness what seems to be a battle of pulse and shadow. It seems as if the red eyed creatures begin to surround the small creatures – and devour them – not before a mirage of pulsing flickering yellow lights contrasts with their red. Then it all stops and the bad creatures seek out the humans watching. The crew run out of the tall grass and back home. Dallas sits silently contemplating – and then without much debate begins to go outside to dig the poles. Dallas begins to take a bunch of cooper wire and hangs them around the poles. He pauses, moves one pole back a few feet, and checks the meter again. Makayla paces the distance between poles with her heel-to-toe steps.The tone drops, spreading wider but losing strength. Asher gives Dominic a tour and explains to Dominic what each of the components are – and how they all function. Asher starts to reach for the dial, then pulls his hand back when it squeals. 

The storm comes and Makayla runs towards her mom – Mr. Mike, Asher and Dominic are outside – Dallas looks stunned as he stares wildly into the tall grass. And he begins to get poles and hang them around. Dominic not saying anything begins to help him. Dallas continues to examine the perimeter around the house. Outside again they have the news van playing on the radio – of Mr Clendenen himself – welcoming Branford into a beautiful southern New England morning.

Dallas Jams the last pole into the mud – and the crew stare at the tall grass. I say leave the creature. Dallas and Makayla dig. Soon they hear the sudden crawl of fire engines – and sea birds – and eventually the hum. Dallas begins to walk back to the house – and the crew behind him. They await on the porch and wait for the perimeter. This is crazy says Dominic – what are we doing here.

**Scene 29**

The sun sets as the crew peer outside – and Dominic suggests that they have some dinner, he wipes the counter hard enough to knock a cup over. Mr Mike agrees that it'll be a good time to eat – so they begin to cook – Dominic and Asher cook – Makayla and Dallas share a glance out the window – as Dallas looks at all of the increasingly bad weather conditions. They eat standing, plates in hand, taking turns at the window – and as they do – the outside the noise begins to grow again – the sounds of sniffs, gnarls, and the – that the creatures – which causes Makayla to rattle in her chair impatiently. Makayla breaks the ice – and asks what they should do – Dominic looks defeated – Dallas remains silent – Mr Mike mumbles in his chair as he rocks back and forth and begins to mumble. He taps the same three beats on the armrest, over and over. – 115.3 MHz – over and over – 115.3 MHz n his chair a bit - over and over again h

Dominic at first is hesitant – and is asking Dallas for answers about the field. Dominic declines and argues that they all should focus on boarding up the house for the storm – but as he speaks – Makayla, in a heap, bolts out the back door, cutting across the yard toward the reeds before anyone can grab her.  The sound spikes once – sharper and shorter and then cuts. Makayla snatches the crystal from her pocket and sprints. Dominic chases her, but cannot reach her in time – and he hesitates as he approaches the tall grass that she just went into. He looks back through the window at Mr. Mike. He cries her name. Asher and Dallas approach the tall grass and stare blankly.

Dallas begins to power on the makeshift poles around the edge of the tall grass. As he does Howie cowers next to him – and Mr Mike watches from the window. Dominic rushes past him to go look for flashlights – he calls Makayla on the two way radio and but is dismayed he discovers that Asher has the other walkie. Dominic asks Dallas to watch Mr Mike and Howie – and He hesitates and then makes out for the grass.

Dallas waits with Howie on the porch and watches his equipment f rom afar. He notices that the little blinking orange light turns greens and hurries over to inspect further .and as he does – watches his equipment – the indicator light is green – and then orange pulses.

The storm approaches and the two get restless and pace around the backyard. Mr. Mike – still inside – hears the thunder and starts to yell pretty loudly that they are coming – they are coming! Dallas looks at his makeshift fence and begins to secure it more – as he does – a distant cry is heard in the distance – followed by the persistent gradual low hum. Night falls and the winds pick up – and the eyes in the fields begin to circulate. Dominic grabs Dallas' sleeve, and Dallas pulls free without turning around. Dallas brings Howie inside – and heads out to the tall grass himself. Dallas leaves the porch light on. He sets Howie's leash on the hook like he'll be back in one minute and gently rubs Howie's face. 

As Dallas walks into the tall grass – a strange silence engulfs him despite the whipping winds outside. He sees a glimmer of fading light and navigates towards it. As he does – the sensation that he is being watched and followed almost overwhelms him – but he presses forward. Dallas stops and pulls a crumpled napking from his pocket - - he opens it up and sees the coordinates 45 L 15 R and it matches his equipment and the little compass that is on the equipment.

In the distance he sees Makayla holding on to one of the creatures – surrounded by a dazed Asher and Dominic who sit next to her – Makayla's eyes are fading as Dallas approaches. In Makayla's hands the creature begins to make calls. And little by little the dark eyes around. As the creature calls – another creature of the same size emerges and begins to nurture.

Dallas makes contact with the creature – and the creature begin to sing a song – and the crew are paralyzed – including the dark forces which cower away. The storm – and the creatures go back into their little holes in the gnarls of the soft trees.

Dallas and Dominic and Makayla all sit by the window and watch for the night to end. And it does. In the morning they wake up – and Dallas is still making calculations – but then lets it go by putting his equipment in the trash. The crew leaves and Dallas is alone again. Although as he looks outside – he hears the soft sound pulse of the creature.

## ACT IV — Aftermath ~10 minutes

**Scene 30**

The next morning, the town is back to normal and people seem to be getting back into their daily routines. The townspeople talk of the strange occurrences over the last couple of days. Pat Clementine the TV host – coins the noreaster last second decision as a unlikely miracle and it was a good safety warning for this town to be prepared.  Behind Pat Clementine – a faint red-pulsing eye emerges from the background fog – if only for a moment.

Dominic and Dallas greet each other at the church event but don't talk much. They sit next to each other and eat their Nica's catered lunch – but still don't talk much. They watch Asher and Makayla in the distance– observe some tiny caterpillar out near the playground – Makayla puts it in a jar.

Makayla and Asher are busy building little devices of their own. As they think that this is just the start of the creature adventure – but Dallas – is still as he is home – at his workshop – he still listens to the tape – as he fiddles with an recording mechanism – Dallas finally gets the device working and hits record as he hears the hum off the tall grass – he begins to create an alphabet with it – he goes to bed that night – and hears echoes -something beyond the shadows that he saw before. The next morning - Janice drops off Howie again and the two hug – Dallas greets the little dog Howie with much affection – and – and Dallas greets him – and the two stare at each other for a while. Soon Howie is disturbed by something out in the tall grass – and Dallas looks at his clock – and then goes to the edge of the tall grass. He stops at the same creek bend – the place where the lawn becomes reed and begins to tune the dial. The dial clicks into place.
