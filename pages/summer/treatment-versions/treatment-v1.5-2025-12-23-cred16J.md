### Arrival & Discovery

**Duration:** ~20 minutes

Dallas moves to town. As he finishes unpacking – Dallas hears a noise from outside – out of curiosity he opens up of his equipment – Dallas pulls out a heavy, military grade receiver – it's covered in dust – he peels back a piece of duct tape to reveal a photo sticker – Dallas and a woman, both wearing heavy audio headsets, laugh in a field of grass. Dallas thumb rushes over her face – and  holds the contact for a beat too long – Dallas presses the sticker on the side of his new receiver. As he does this -  he hears a hum.  Dallas records readings but the battery dies. Dallas walks into town for batteries – and on the way – he meets his neighbor Dominic – who follows him on his journey. On the way, Dominic convinces Dallas to come to a fellowship lunch at his church. They go. 

As they venture towards the church– Dominic discovers that there is a ticket on his car and upset, begins a long rant about the towns raccoon problems and wonder where all of his money is going. As Dominic rants – Dallas notices a row of birds perched on a power line – all facing the direction towards the marsh. Dallas and Dominic arrive at CPC and find themselves in a circle with other church goers outside eating Sally's at the fellowship hall in the late summer – the last fellowship hall lunch of the summer. While Dallas and Dominic walk home they walk towards the marsh – and the wind – and the New England coast – as they walk coyotes howl in the far distance – "What are you here for" asks Dominic – "Work" answers Dallas "At Yale?" "Quinnipiac" – Dallas explains that he is going to work next semester – so he has a couple of months of to get settled. Nice  "So are you here alone?" – "Yep" - 

The two get lost around Branford for a bit – wandering through different marsh lands and tall grass. Dominic listens to the surrounding area – and explains to Dallas all of the different type of birds – and the how he has an app that the phone could tell the species. As they continue – they witness a bunch of news vans huddled outside of the nearby town center. News specialist Pat Clendenen – bangs on about the Nor'easter – and prepares folks for wild set of upcoming weather – hopefully that doesn't come past this weekend's festival. 

As they approach the house – Dominic becomes more and more upset – as he notices that his trash cans are duped over the side of the house Dominic invitees Dallas over to help him clean a mess that the kids made while they were over – mainly just furniture needs to be rearranged  – and while they are exiting Dominic's house moving – Dallas notices a painting of someone who is no longer around – Dallas looks for a moment and gets a moment of looks and meets eyes with Mr. Mike – who is in the corner yelling. Dominic walks over – "Yeah yeah – that was my wife – and my child" Dominic asks if Dallas had someone special in his life "Yes, but not anymore" – they look at each other – yeah – it has been tough – how you holding up? Alright – how are you holding up? Alright – Mr Mike begins to look out the window and is getting flustered at the weather. "She's here – he yells". Dallas notices that Mr Mike isn't just yelling – he is scratching coordinates on the wooden end table. Dominic seeing this rushes over to stop him. 45 Left 15 degrees right -Mr Mike says – much to Dominic's dismasy. 

All of a sudden Dominics sister Janice visits with her kids, teasing Dallas into Dog sitting her dog Howie – Dallas agrees. Janice walks over to discover that Dominic is cooking the brusque sprouts incorrectly – and the gravy is a mess. An argument erupts. All of a sudden – Janice starts to look for her keys in a frantic way – stumbling upon Dallas' equipment – which the her daughter Makayla – a young 20 something – walks towards and peppers questions about the equipment .Asher, her little brother – 15 looks at the distant bushes after greeting Mr. Mike haphazardly. Dominic ushers everyone to get into the car – they are going to be late – the crew in a whirlwind of activity, leave Dallas alone with the dog Howie.

As he walks home with Howie, The Long Island Sound roars against the Branford rocks, and Dallas notices that his portable reader spikes violently near the distant field near the tall grass. Dallas starts to tune the frequency to the same one as before. Distant dogs bark in the distance – followed by even further away coyotes – and the storm alerts pop up. The hum begins – and it grows denser and deeper and eventually everywhere – Dallas checks his surroundings and begins to stare at it in a daze – Howie is afraid which prompts Dallas to move on.

That night, Dallas stands at the window, staring into the ripping field. Dominic shows up with Asher to collect Howie and asks if everything is okay – "It is fine" replies Dallas. Later that night, Dallas looks out the window again at the marsh – his equipment ready but they read silent – he touches a photo of his late wife – and then the hum begins. As Dallas looks tall shadows grow in the distance and move against the wind. The distant sounds becomes more distinct – but distant.

## ACT II

### The Creature

**Duration:** ~30 minutes

Dawn. The storm approaches. Janice drops off her dog Howie before rushing to work at the museum, where she's helping secure artwork before the hurricane hits. She thanks Dallas tremendously who, in return, doesn't say much – but begins to have an a kinship with this little dog. Outside, Makayla and Asher run off in the distance to look at something in the far distance of Dallas' house – she yells at them to get to the car – and calls  that the schools were canceled due to the weather – but she thinks it is all the bull. Dominic emerges from the mini-van to help the kids in – and runs over – greets Howie – and asks Dallas if he needs anything from Costco and hands him a bunch of papers for all of the life group tonight – thanks for doing this. 

Dallas and Howie step out into a long trail around their costal neighborhood – they stop by the creek behind their house – and suddenly from a distance – the roar and hum begin. Howie's ears perk up and runs up to Dallas as if he wants to be held. Dallas holds Howie. And as  he does – a light flickers in the far distance. Dallas is drawn to the light – and in a daze begins to walk towards it – much to Howie's objections. Dallas' equipment begins to beep – and Dallas – noticing this – ties Howie to a nearby tree on the edge of the salt marsh – and begins to enter the tall grass. 

As he does – and almost in a daze – Dallas walks to a shrunken tree hollow – where it almost looks like dozens of eyes surround him through the tall yellow reeds – in that hollow a movement of leaves – and in that movement – a cry of what sounds like an animal. The cry continues – putting Dallas into a daze as he begins to approach it. 

As Dallas approaches the hollow – he sees a shrunken leaf pile – as he moves closer he discovers that something is dying inside of it. As he approaches closer and closer he gasps – for in front of him is is a tiny otherwordly creature. The creature breathes heavily – and emits the cry – but it doesn't come out of his mouth – instead the noise is caused by certain flapping holes of its back – as if it is a bit of an instrument – it lets out a cry. The creature is fragile, birdlike, covered in downy fur, with long rabbit-like ears and a diminishing flickering glow beneath its neck. Dallas – amazed by the creature – stares for a good while at its complexity and beauty – when suddenly – he realizes that its pulse is slowing. Dallas moves closer and touches the back of the creature – as he does – the creature quiets down and its rhymes of its "back-holes" line up perfectly with his equipment readings. In the distance suddenly – Dallas senses an urgent fear – as if something massive is following him in the distance – rocketing closer and closer through the blades like an arrow – Dallas quickly grabs the creature in his coat – and rushes outside. Howie does not like this – and begins to freak out. Dallas, the creature, and Howie – make the long journey back to the house. 

When Dallas finally arrives – he brings it into his kitchen – and as he does – his outdoor porch begin to sing like instruments.  Dallas soon discovers that the instruments pulse in sync with the creatures heartbeat – and as the creature begins to fade – Dallas tries to turn the dial into a normal frequency and that seems to put the creature to sleep. Howie – disturbed in the corner – waits by the door for his owner and Dallas – tries to hide the creature – but when it cries – the world outside echoes – and then the ugly hum responds with a source far away. The hum floods the town. Windows rattle.

Janice and Dominic return – carrying loads of haphazard boxes from Costco – Dominic thanks Dallas again for letting the life group meet tonight at their house and as they explain – Dallas tries to avoid them going to the creature – Mr Mike walks in and begins to freak out – his points to the creature – and says what is that – what is that?  Makayla walking behind him spots the creature and, without fear, attends to its wound. Its glow begins to brighten with her touch. Asher joins the huddle – and Dominic yells for everyone to be calm. And then he himself notices the creature and pushes everyone out of the way. 

Dominic, flabbergasted sits silently as the crew huddle around the kitchen table. Dallas puts little tiny wires on the creatures head as Janice lists off possible species and Dominic begins to argue about types of birds from the ground. Mr. Mike argues that they are all are wrong.   – Dominic begins to list off all of the reasons – Janice begins to say that they should put it back where they found it – they can't have it in the house – and Mr Mike begins to yell that they need to leave now – that they are coming for the creature – and that it is not safe here.  

As the crew scramble with the creature downstairs - the door bell upstairs chimes – the first family to join the life group – a young couple with a newborn JP – enter the scene and begin to introduce themselves to Dallas who acts a bit off – Dominic paces in the kitchen – and Mr Mike mutters to himself in the chair – looks at the weather outside getting worse – and utters that this is all a farce – they should be out their and return the creature. But the couple knows to politely ignore Mr Mike – who begins to mutter to himself, almost in frustration – 45 degrees to the left – 15 to the right.

More and more families begin to arrive – filling up Dallas' little kitchen and living room. The crowd try the toasted Brussel sprouts while Janice does her best to find a cup for everyone for the apple cider. Dallas excuses himself to the basement to go check on Howie – but really he goes and checks on the status of the dying creature. Across the room he looks across the room at his old equipment with the pile of tripods. For a moment the creature doesn't look like it is doing much – but its breathing slightly – Dallas struggles to find a bed for it – and settles on an old shoe box – he takes one with his wife's equipment puts it aside and gently nestles the small creature into it – as it breathes slowly and its little wings curl tightly. Makayla and Asher bring Dallas sneak down the stairs to get a look– and Dallas finds a way to poke a hole to make it drinkable – Makayla and Asher watch from the staircase. 

Dallas goes upstairs to life group and is asked how Howie is doing – where is Howie – and the leader Josh – one of the young couples – begins to give an opening ice breaker – while Dallas, Dominic and his two kids kind of sit silent. Tyler hands out music for everyone to sing and they do. As the final notes of the hymn breach to a close – the hum begins to start up again. People look at each other and make comments – Pat – the weatherman, also life group member – begins to relish on the weather.

During the time of reflection – the hum begins to start up again – leaving everyone unsettled and asking questions as to what in the world that noise was. The group settles on talk of the weird weather patterns that have been plaguing the Branford community and that what the status of this upcoming storm is. In time – people leave and hug goodbye – as Dominic waves them goodbye – he waits for the last person to leave before he rushes downstairs with the kids to see what the deal is with the creature that Dallas' has been nursing. 

The creature is in some makeshift box and Dallas has a heat lamp to it – and is curious that the creature, like a little bird responds to his machines that he haphardaly arranged around it like a mini-hospital. Asher notices that the little creature seemed to be quite curious as the creature is better and a bit awake and is pushing pebbles to one side of the box – he finds that small objects arranged like the pebbles from the floor – all arranged in a certain pattern – but when the crew look back at the creature – they see that it is sleeping still. They don't seem to be. It is sleeping it seems. In the morning the crew decided that it will go and drop it off where they found it. As they discuss this Dallas stares blankly half listening. The hum is back. Dominic and Janice and the kids leave with Mr Mike – who tells them that it is a mistake to not return the creature tonight. 

That night Dallas stares awake and looks out the tall window – in the distance – through his backyard-  he notices watch appear to be dim red eyes in the great distance -  as Dallas looks closer the eyes look like they are swirling through the blades of grass watching his house. It looks like little pulses of red lights that go inch by inch closer to the edge. Dallas makes his way downstairs to check on the creature – but it is gone – nervous he looks out and the eys are gone and the night is still. 

## ACT III

### The Return

**Duration:** ~30 minutes

Makayla, as she drops off Howie - looks at weird burn marks on his grass near the driveway – and how it looks like the trail leads to the windows of the house – and then a little burn mark on the side of the house. She can't seem to find Dallas – he is staring at the abyss outside with a tiny detector. Makayla watches Dallas for a moment and then begins to copy him. The two begin to make a fence around the house. Dallas looks over and acknowledges her presence. Makayla asks what happens and Dallas the creature is gone. But it was injured. Together they hear another cry that sounds like a big distant – the creatures – and then that familiar hum. Makayla turns to Dallas – we have to go get it back – they want to kill it. Dallas and Makayla begin to walk the trail with Howie – and see the same glow. They rush over – and by and by – as they inch closer to the salt marsh - they find a group of creatures all attending to the injured creature from before. 

At first, the creatures scatter about – the younger ones – two or three of them - but the older ones wave their hands a bit – and Makayla and Dallas are frozen. They can move their heads and but not their bodies nor hands.  In the quiet moments later, more lights appear. Dozens of glows rise like lanterns in the distant mist. All around them the predators emerge – with their glowing red eyes and for every inch they creep – their shadow goes up the tall grass. The paralysis of Dallas and Makayla – seems to be caused by an elder of the good creatures and their full might – but are no match – they begin to focus on the predators actions.

The predators eyes blink a bit and causes great fear amount the creatures to huddle around. Dallas and Makayla move slowly away and walk briskly back the way they came – but not before Dallas has one more interaction with -  the tiny little creature in the distance – its pulse blinks large – and then diminishes – awful sound of gnashing engulf – and Dallas – caught in the moment – takes out his dial – and it causes the creature to pulse again – and the creatures retract. Dallas quickly grabs the creature and runs out. 

As Dallas runs – he stops – and realizes that the creature has stopped pulsing all together – and now is motionless – he puts the creature down – and other pulses gather – hearing the snarls Dallas makes his way out of the tall grass.

As the crew watch in the distance they witness what seems to be a battle of pulse and shadow. It seems as if the red eyed creatures begin to surround the small creatures – and devour them – not before a mirage of pulsing flickering yellow lights contrasts with their red.  Then it all stops and the bad creatures seek out the humans watching. The crew run out of the tall grass and back home. Dallas sits silently contemplating – and then without much debate begins to go outside to dig the poles. Dallas begins to take a bunch of cooper wire and hangs them around the poles – checking his equipment to make sure they are in tune. 

The storm comes and Makayla runs towards her mom – Mr. Mike, Asher and Dominic are outside – Dallas looks stunned. And he begins to get poles and hang them around. Dominic not saying anything begins to help him. Dallas continues to examine the perimeter around the house. Outside again they have the news van playing on the radio – of Mr Clendenen himself – welcoming Branford into a beautiful southern New England morning. 

Dallas Jams the last pole into the mud – and the crew stare at the tall grass. I say leave the creature. Dallas and Makayla dig. Soon they hear the sudden crawl of fire engines – and sea birds – and eventually the hum. Dallas begins to walk back to the house – and the crew behind him. They await on the porch and wait for the perimeter. This is crazy says Dominic – what are we doing here. 

The sun sets as the crew peer outside – and Dominic suggests that they have some dinner – Janice agrees and start cooking some Pasta and Mr Mike agrees that it'll be a good time to eat – so they begin to eat – and as they do – they eat in silence – and as they do – the outside the noise begins to grow again – and the same sounds of sniffs – that the creatures  – which causes Makayla to rattle in her chair impatiently. Makayla breaks the ice – and asks what they should do – Dominic looks defeated – Dallas remains silent – Mr Mike rumbles in his chair a bit  - over and over again he begins to mutter to – 45 degrees to the left – 15 to the right –– and  a decision here if should go back – they do go back – and they see the creature again – and they try to grab it – but the eyes follow them. Dominic at first is hesitant – and is asking Dallas for answers about the field. Dominic declines and argues that they all should focus on boarding up the house for the storm – but as he speaks – Makayla, in a heap, runs out the door and straight into the tall grass. Dominic chases her, but cannot reach her in time – and he hesitates as he approaches the tall grass that she just went into. His cries her name. Asher and Dallas approaches the tall grass and stares blankly. 

Dallas begins to power on the makeshift poles around the edge of the tall grass. As he does Howie cowers next to him – and Mr Mike watches from the window. Dominic rushes past him to go look for flashlights – he calls Makayla on the two way radio and but is dismayed he discovers that Asher has the other walkie. Dominic asks Dallas to watch Mr Mike and Howie – and He hesitates and then makes out for the grass. 

Dallas waits with Howie on the porch and watches his equipment f  rom afar. He notices that the little blinking orange light turns greens and hurries over to inspect further .and as he does – watches his equipment – the indicator light is green – and then orange pulses. 

 The storm approaches and the two get restless and pace around the backyard. Mr. Mike – still inside – hears the thunder and starts to yell pretty loudly that they are coming – they are coming! Dallas looks at his makeshift fence and begins to secure it more – as he does – a distant cry is heard in the distance – followed by the persistent gradual low hum. Night falls and the winds pick up – and the eyes in the fields begin to circulate. Dallas brings Howie inside – and heads out to the tall grass himself. 

As Dallas walks into the tall grass – a strange silence engulfs him despite the whipping winds outside. He sees a glimmer of fading light and navigates towards it. As he does – the sensation that he is being watched and followed almost overwhelms him – but he presses forward. Dallas stops and pulls a crumpled napking from his pocket - - he opens it up and sees the coordinates 45 L 15 R and it matches his equipment and the little compass that is on the equipment. 

In the distance he sees Makayla holding on to one of the creatures – surrounded by a dazed Asher and Dominic who sit next to her – Makayla's eyes are fading as Dallas approaches. In Makayla's hands the creature begins to make calls. And little by little the dark eyes around. As the creature calls – another creature of the same size emerges and begins to nurture. 

Dallas makes contact with the creature – and the creature begin to sing a song – and the crew are paralyzed – including the dark forces which cower away. The storm – and the creatures go back into their little holes in the gnarls of the soft trees.

Dallas and Dominic and Makayla all sit by the window and watch for the night to end. And it does. In the morning they wake up – and Dallas is still making calculations – but then lets it go by putting his equipment in the trash. The crew leaves and Dallas is alone again. Although as he looks outside – he hears the soft sound pulse of the creature. 

## ACT IV

### Aftermath

**Duration:** ~10 minutes

The next morning the town is back to normal and people seem to be getting into their daily routines. Pat Clementine the TV host – reports back a miracle of a save – where half way through the storm seemed to counter direct. Behind Pat Clemeinite – a faint red-pulsing eye emerges from the background fog – if only for a moment. 

Dominic and Dallas greet each other at the church event but don't talk much. They sit next to each other and eat their Nica's catered lunch – but still don't talk too much. They watch Asher and Makayla – observe some tiny caterpillar out near the playground – Makayla puts it in a jar.  

Makayla and Asher are busy building little devices of their own. As they think that this is just the start of the creature adventure – but Dallas – is still as he is home – hears echoes in the tall grass -something beyond the shadows that he saw before. Janice drops off Howie again – and Dallas greets him – and the two watch the sun set. Dallas walks over to the picture of his wife and then to Howie and then to the tall grass. Dallas turns off his equipment – and begins to live with the salt breeze from the marsh.
