## "A quiet stunner about grief, frequency, and the things that hum back"

*By Film Review Staff*

There is a moment in **Creatures in the Tall Grass** where Dallas, a bioacoustics researcher played with extraordinary restraint, peels duct tape off a piece of military-grade audio equipment to reveal a photo sticker of himself and his late wife, both wearing headsets, laughing in a field. His thumb lingers on her face. He doesn't say anything. He doesn't need to. The rest of the film is about what happens when the world starts talking back to a man who has spent his whole life listening.

AG's debut feature drops Dallas into Branford, Connecticut — a coastal New England town rendered with the kind of specificity that suggests the filmmaker has walked every sidewalk in it. There are raccoon complaints, parking tickets, fellowship lunches with church-catered food, and brussels sprout arguments between siblings. The film is in no hurry. When Dallas meets his neighbor Dominic — warm, talkative, carrying his own quiet losses — the two orbit each other with the wary tenderness of men who know what absence feels like but won't name it.

The genre elements arrive the way weather does in southern Connecticut: gradually, then all at once. A hum from the salt marsh. Equipment that spikes and dies. Burn marks in the yard. And eventually, deep in the tall grass behind Dallas's house, a dying creature — birdlike, fragile, with downy fur and rabbit ears — that doesn't cry from its mouth. Instead, sound pours from delicate holes in its back, like air forced through a living reed. The holes flutter in sequence like fingers running a scale. It is one of the most original creature designs in recent memory, and the film wisely never over-reveals it.

What distinguishes **Creatures** from the current wave of indie sci-fi is its refusal to escalate in the expected ways. The supernatural elements are filtered through a deeply domestic lens: the creature is hidden during a church life group meeting. Its cries are covered up by hymn singing. Its makeshift hospital is a shoebox in a basement. The most terrifying moment in the film isn't the red-eyed predators circling in the marsh — it's Mr. Mike, the elderly man Dominic cares for, scratching numbers into a wooden end table and muttering "115.3 MHz" while everyone politely ignores him. He has been hearing the frequency longer than anyone. Nobody listened.

Makayla, Dominic's 22-year-old niece, is the film's secret weapon. Where Dallas approaches the creatures with scientific caution and Dominic with protective anxiety, Makayla operates on pure instinct. She touches the crystal without hesitation. She adjusts Dallas's equipment and his readings jump. When the moment comes, she grabs the crystal and sprints into the tall grass without a word, and the film shifts from slow-burn unease into something genuinely breathtaking. Her sprint is the hinge of the entire film.

The climactic sequence in the marsh — golden bioluminescent lights rising like lanterns against circling red eyes — could have tipped into spectacle, but AG keeps it grounded in Dallas's perspective, filtered through his scope and his readings. The sound design carries the weight. When the creatures sing, you feel it in your sternum. When the predators close in, you feel the absence of sound. That's the real horror here: not noise, but silence.

The final act is small and perfect. Dallas puts his equipment in the trash. Then takes it back out. He plays his wife's tape one more time and starts building an alphabet from the hum. He's not trying to capture it or study it anymore. He's learning to speak it. The last image — Dallas at the edge of the tall grass, tuning the dial until it clicks into place, Howie beside him — is the kind of ending that sits with you for days. He doesn't go in. He doesn't need to. He can hear them from here.

**Creatures in the Tall Grass** is a film about a widower who moves to a small town and discovers aliens in the marsh, and it barely raises its voice the entire time. It is a film about listening — to grief, to frequency, to the people around you, to the things that hum beneath the surface of the world. It belongs on a shelf next to **Arrival**, **Beasts of the Southern Wild**, and **The Vast of Night**. It is one of the best films at the festival.
