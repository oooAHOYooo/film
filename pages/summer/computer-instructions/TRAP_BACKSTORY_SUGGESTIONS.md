# Suggestions: Dallas Finding Makayla’s Traps on Howie Walks

*Add these where you like; do not replace existing text. Use as beats you can drop in or adapt.*

---

## Why it helps

- **01_arrival:** Makayla says Asher and his friends are “hunting for evidence around the marsh” and asks to borrow the Oscillator. If we’ve already seen Dallas finding their traps on his Howie walks, that line pays off instead of introducing the idea.
- **06_the_coordinates:** When Makayla asks about frequencies “below the human range” and “like a vibrating lung,” we already know she’s been out there with mics and rigs—she’s not just curious, she’s been building.

## Where to add (in order of story)

### 1. **07_dallas_marsh_walk.md**

**Existing text:** “There in the distance he sees a distubrance. He walks over to a makeshift trap with a trailcam over it. He notices that it is wired to a solar pack and away from itself. Howie runs up to it and smells it.”

**Suggestions (add only, don’t replace):**

- **Before or after that block:** Add that he’s found a few of these now—different stretches of the trail, same kind of rig. So this is “another one,” not a one-off.
- **Detail you could add:** A few feet from the trail cam, a cheap microphone wired to a recorder (callback to Makayla’s “could we put some microphones in the tall grass” in 01).
- **Behavior:** He doesn’t dismantle it. Maybe he looks at it a beat, then moves on. Howie already sniffs it—you can keep that.

*Result:* By 07 we know the kids have been systematically setting up traps; the Oscillator ask is the next step.

### 2. **10_shadows_in_wind.md** (Branford rocks — Dallas and Howie before the hum)

**Where:** Early in the scene, when Dallas is walking Howie along the perimeter (before “Dallas holds his portable reader out”).

**Suggestion:**

- Howie tugs toward the reeds. Dallas sees another setup: e.g. string between two stalks, a bottle with the bottom cut off over trampled grass, or a small stake with something rigged to it.
- One short line of internal or behavioral beat: he’s seen enough of these that he’s stopped counting; or he recognizes the same “evidence hunting” logic.
- He doesn’t break it—nudges it or steps around it, keeps walking.

*Result:* Recurring pattern without dialogue; when the hum starts, we’ve already established that the marsh is both his route and the kids’ “lab.”

## Optional: one more beat

- **05_marsh_walk.md:** This is Dallas + Dominic (no Howie). If you ever add a beat where they pass the trail or the edge of the marsh, Dominic could point out “the kids are always out here with their cameras” or Dallas could notice a stake in the reeds—tiny reinforcement that the traps are part of the neighborhood.

## Trap details you can reuse

So the traps feel like the same “project” across scenes:

- Trail cam (already in 07) + solar or battery pack.
- Cheap microphone or recorder (ties to Makayla’s ask in 01).
- String, bottles, or stakes—low-tech “evidence” setups.
- Optional: a note in a Ziploc (only in one scene, e.g. 11_howie_walk) so it feels personal, not random.

---

## What to avoid

- Dallas never has to say “Makayla” or “Asher” at the traps. The payoff is in 01 when we meet them and hear “hunting for evidence” / borrow the Oscillator.
- No need for him to dismantle or take anything; leaving them in place keeps it observational and a bit mysterious until we meet the kids.

Use or drop any of these; they’re additive suggestions only.
